<h1>TOM SWIFT AND HIS SUBMARINE BOAT</h1>

<h2><a name="CH1" id="CH1">Chapter One</a></h2>

<h3>News of a Treasure Wreck</h3>

<p>There was a rushing, whizzing, throbbing noise in the air.
 A great body, like that of some immense bird, sailed along,
 casting a grotesque shadow on the ground below. An elderly
 man, who was seated on the porch of a large house, started
 to his feet in alarm.</p>

<p> &quot;Gracious goodness! What was that, Mrs. Baggert?&quot; he
 called to a motherly-looking woman who stood in the doorway.
 &quot;What happened?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing much, Mr. Swift,&quot; was the calm reply &quot;I think
 that was Tom and Mr. Sharp in their airship, that's all. I
 didn't see it, but the noise sounded like that of the Red
Cloud.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course! To be sure!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Barton Swift, the
 well-known inventor, as he started down the path in order to
 get a good view of the air, unobstructed by the trees. &quot;Yes,
 there they are,&quot; he added. &quot;That's the airship, but I didn't
 expect them back so soon. They must have made good time from
 Shopton. I wonder if anything can be the matter that they
 hurried so?&quot;</p>

<p>He gazed aloft toward where a queerly-shaped machine was
 circling about nearly five hundred feet in the air, for the
 craft, after Swooping down close to the house, had ascended
 and was now hovering just above the line of breakers that
 marked the New Jersey seacoast, where Mr. Swift had taken up
 a temporary residence.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't begin worrying, Mr. Swift,&quot; advised Mrs. Baggert,
 the housekeeper. &quot;You've got too much to do, if you get that
 new boat done, to worry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's so. I must not worry. But I wish Tom and Mr. Sharp
 would land, for I want to talk to them.&quot;</p>

<p>As if the occupants of the airship had heard the words of
 the aged inventor, they headed their craft toward earth. The
 combined aeroplane and dirigible balloon, a most wonderful
 traveler of the air, swung around, and then, with the
 deflection rudders slanted downward, came on with a rush.
 When near the landing place, just at the side of the house,
 the motor was stopped, and the gas, with a hissing noise,
 rushed into the red aluminum container. This immediately
 made the ship more buoyant and it landed almost as gently as
 a feather.</p>

<p>No sooner had the wheels which formed the lower part of
 the craft touched the ground than there leaped from the
 cabin of the Red Cloud a young man.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, dad!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Here we are again, safe and
 sound. Made a record, too. Touched ninety miles an hour at
 times--didn't we, Mr. Sharp?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's what,&quot; agreed a tall, thin, dark-complexioned man,
 who followed Tom Swift more leisurely in his exit from the
 cabin. Mr. Sharp, a veteran aeronaut, stopped to fasten guy
 ropes from the airship to strong stakes driven into the
 ground.</p>

<p>&quot;And we'd have done better, only we struck a hard wind
 against us about two miles up in the air, which delayed us,&quot;
 went on Tom. &quot;Did you hear us coming, dad?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and it startled him,&quot; put in Mrs. Baggert. &quot;I guess
 he wasn't expecting you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, well, I shouldn't have been so alarmed, only I was
 thinking deeply about a certain change I am going to make in
 the submarine, Tom. I was day-dreaming, I think, when your
 ship whizzed through the air. But tell me, did you find
 everything all right at Shopton? No signs of any of those
 scoundrels of the Happy Harry gang having been around?&quot; and
 Mr. Swift looked anxiously at his son.</p>

<p>&quot;Not a sign, dad,&quot; replied Tom quickly. &quot;Everything was
 all right. We brought the things you wanted. They're in the
 airship. Oh, but it was a fine trip. I'd like to take
 another right out to sea.&quot;</p>

<p>
 &quot;Not now, Tom,&quot; said his father. &quot;I want you to help me.
 And I need Mr. Sharp's help, too. Get the things out of the
 car, and we'll go to the shop.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;First I think we'd better put the airship away,&quot; advised
 Mr. Sharp. &quot;I don't just like the looks of the weather, and,
 besides, if we leave the ship exposed we'll be sure to have
 a crowd around sooner or later, and we don't want that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, indeed,&quot; remarked the aged inventor hastily. &quot;I don't
 want people prying around the submarine shed. By all means
 put the airship away, and then come into the shop.&quot;</p>

<p>In spite of its great size the aeroplane was easily
 wheeled along by Tom and Mr. Sharp, for the gas in the
 container made it so buoyant that it barely touched the
 earth. A little more of the powerful vapor and the Red
 Cloud would have risen by itself. In a few minutes the
 wonderful craft, of which my readers have been told in
 detail in a previous volume, was safely housed in a large
 tent, which was securely fastened.</p>

<p>Mr. Sharp and Tom, carrying some bundles which they had
 taken from the car, or cabin, of the craft, went toward a
 large shed, which adjoined the house that Mr. Swift had
 hired for the season at the seashore. They found the lad's
 father standing before a great shape, which loomed up dimly
 in the semi-darkness of the building. It was like an immense
 cylinder, pointed at either end, and here and there were
 openings, covered with thick glass, like immense, bulging
 eyes. From the number of tools and machinery all about the
 place, and from the appearance of the great cylinder itself,
 it was easy to see that it was only partly completed.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, how goes it, dad?&quot; asked the youth, as he deposited
 his bundle on a bench. &quot;Do you think you can make it work?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think so, Tom. The positive and negative plates are
 giving me considerable trouble, though. But I guess we can
 solve the problem. Did you bring me the galvanometer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and all the other things,&quot; and the young inventor
 proceeded to take the articles from the bundles he carried.</p>

<p>Mr. Swift looked them over carefully, while Tom walked
 about examining the submarine, for such was the queer craft
 that was contained in the shed. He noted that some progress
 had been made on it since he had left the seacoast several
 days before to make a trip to Shopton, in New York State,
 where the Swift home was located, after some tools and
 apparatus that his father wanted to obtain from his workshop
 there.</p>

<p>&quot;You and Mr. Jackson have put on several new plates,&quot;
 observed the lad after a pause.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; admitted his father. &quot;Garret and I weren't idle,
 were we, Garret?&quot; and he nodded to the aged engineer, who
 had been in his employ for many years.</p>

<p>&quot;No; and I guess we'll soon have her in the water, Tom,
 now that you and Mr. Sharp are here to help us,&quot; replied
 Garret Jackson.</p>

<p>&quot;We ought to have Mr. Damon here to bless the submarine
 and his liver and collar buttons a few times,&quot; put in Mr.
 Sharp, who brought in another bundle. He referred to an
 eccentric individual Who had recently made an airship voyage
 with himself and Tom, Mr. Damon's peculiarity being to use
 continually such expressions as: &quot;Bless my soul! Bless my
 liver!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I'll be glad when we can make a trial trip,&quot; went
 on Tom. &quot;I've traveled pretty fast on land with my motor-
 cycle, and we certainly have hummed through the air. Now I
 want to see how it feels to scoot along under water.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if everything goes well we'll be in position to
 make a trial trip inside of a month,&quot; remarked the aged
 inventor. &quot;Look here, Mr. Sharp, I made a change in the
 steering gear, which I'd like you and Tom to consider.&quot;</p>

<p>The three walked around to the rear of the odd-looking
 structure, if an object shaped like a cigar can be said to
 have a front and rear, and the inventor, his son, and the
 aeronaut were soon deep in a discussion of the
 technicalities connected with under-water navigation.</p>

<p>A little later they went into the house, in response to a
 summons from the supper bell, vigorously rung by Mrs.
 Baggert. She was not fond of waiting with meals, and even
 the most serious problem of mechanics was, in her
 estimation, as nothing compared with having the soup get
 cold, or the possibility of not having the meat done to a
 turn.</p>

<p>The meal was interspersed with remarks about the recent
 airship flight of Tom and Mr. Sharp, and discussions about
 the new submarine. This talk went on even after the table
 was cleared off and the three had adjourned to the sitting-
 room. There Mr. Swift brought out pencil and paper, and soon
 he and Mr. Sharp were engrossed in calculating the pressure
 per square inch of sea water at a depth of three miles.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you intend to go as deep as that?&quot; asked Tom, looking
 up from a paper he was reading.</p>

<p>&quot;Possibly,&quot; replied his father; and his son resumed his
 perusal of the sheet.</p>

<p>&quot;Now,&quot; went on the inventor to the aeronaut, &quot;I have
 another plan. In addition to the positive and negative
 plates which will form our motive power, I am going to
 install forward and aft propellers, to use in case of
 accident.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I say, dad! Did you see this?&quot; suddenly exclaimed Tom,
 getting up from his chair, and holding his finger on a
 certain place in the page of the paper.</p>

<p>&quot;Did I see what?&quot; asked Mr. Swift.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, this account of the sinking of the treasure ship.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Treasure ship? No. Where?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Listen,&quot; went on Tom. &quot;I'll read it: 'Further advices
 from Montevideo, Uruguay, South America, state that all hope
 has been given up of recovering the steamship Boldero, which
 foundered and went down off that coast in the recent gale.
 Not only has all hope been abandoned of raising the vessel,
 but it is feared that no part of the three hundred thousand
 dollars in gold bullion which she carried will ever be
 recovered. Expert divers who were taken to the scene of the
 wreck state that the depth of water, and the many currents
 existing there, due to a submerged shoal, preclude any
 possibility of getting at the hull. The bullion, it is
 believed, was to have been used to further the interests of
 a certain revolutionary faction, but it seems likely that
 they will have to look elsewhere for the sinews of war.
 Besides the bullion the ship also carried several cases of
 rifles, it is stated, and other valuable cargo. The crew and
 what few passengers the Boldero carried were, contrary to
 the first reports, all saved by taking to the boats. It
 appears that some of the ship's plates were sprung by the
 stress in which she labored in a storm, and she filled and
 sank gradually.' There! what do you think of that, dad?&quot;
 cried Tom as he finished.</p>

<p>&quot;What do I think of it? Why, I think it's too bad for the
 revolutionists, Tom, of course.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; I mean about the treasure being still on board the
 ship. What about that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's likely to stay there, if the divers can't get
 at it. Now, Mr. Sharp, about the propellers--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, dad!&quot; cried Tom earnestly.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Tom, what's the matter?&quot; asked Mr. Swift in some
 surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;How soon before we can finish our submarine?&quot; went on
 Tom, not answering the question.</p>

<p>&quot;About a month. Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why? Dad, why can't we have a try for that treasure? It
 ought to be comparatively easy to find that sunken ship off
 the coast of Uruguay. In our submarine we can get close up
 to it, and in the new diving suits you invented we can get
 at that gold bullion. Three hundred thousand dollars! Think
 of it, dad! Three hundred thousand dollars! We could easily
 claim all of it, since the owners have abandoned it, but we
 would be satisfied with half. Let's hurry up, finish the
 submarine, and have a try for it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, Tom, you forget that I am to enter my new ship in
 the trials for the prize offered by the United States
 Government.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How much is the prize if you win it?&quot; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;Fifty thousand dollars.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, here's a chance to make three times that much at
 least, and maybe more. Dad, let the Government prize go, and
 try for the treasure. Will you?&quot;</p>

<p>Tom looked eagerly at his father, his eyes shining with
 anticipation. Mr. Swift was not a quick thinker, but the
 idea his son had proposed made an impression on him. He
 reached out his hand for the paper in which the young
 inventor had seen the account of the sunken treasure.
 Slowly he read it through. Then he passed it to Mr. Sharp.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you think of it?&quot; he asked of the aeronaut</p>

<p>&quot;There's a possibility,&quot; remarked the balloonist &quot;We might
 try for it. We can easily go three miles down, and it
 doesn't lie as deeply as that, if this account is true. Yes,
 we might try for it. But we'd have to omit the Government
 contests.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will you, dad?&quot; asked Tom again.</p>

<p>Mr. Swift considered a moment longer.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Tom, I will,&quot; he finally decided. &quot;Going after the
 treasure will be likely to afford us a better test of the
 submarine than would any Government tests. We'll try to
 locate the sunken Boldero.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hurrah!&quot; cried the lad, taking the paper from Mr. Sharp
 and waving it in the air. &quot;That's the stuff! Now for a
 search for the submarine treasure!&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH2" id="CH2">Chapter Two</a></h2>

<h3>Finishing the Submarine</h3>

<p>
 &quot;What's the matter?&quot; cried Mrs. Baggert, the housekeeper,
 hurrying in from the kitchen, where she was washing the
 dishes. &quot;Have you seen some of those scoundrels who robbed
 you, Mr. Swift? If you have, the police down here ought
to--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's nothing like that,&quot; explained Mr. Swift. &quot;Tom
 has merely discovered in the paper an account of a sunken
 treasure ship, and he wants us to go after it, down under
 the ocean.&quot;</p>

<p>
 &quot;Oh, dear! Some more of Captain Kidd's hidden hoard, I
 suppose?&quot; ventured the housekeeper. &quot;Don't you bother with
 it, Mr. Swift. I had a cousin once, and he got set in the
 notion that he knew where that pirate's treasure was. He
 spent all the money he had and all he could borrow digging
 for it, and he never found a penny. Don't waste your time on
 such foolishness. It's bad enough to be building airships
 and submarines without going after treasure.&quot; Mrs. Baggert
 spoke with the freedom of an old friend rather than a hired
 housekeeper, but she had been in the family ever since Tom's
 mother died, when he was a baby, and she had many
 privileges.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, this isn't any of Kidd's treasure,&quot; Tom assured her.
 &quot;If we get it, Mrs. Baggert, I'll buy you a diamond ring.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Humph!&quot; she exclaimed, as Tom began to hug her in boyish
 fashion. &quot;I guess I'll have to buy all the diamond rings I
 want, if I have to depend on your treasure for them,&quot; and
 she went back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; went on Mr. Swift after a pause, &quot;if we are going
 into the treasure-hunting business, Tom, we'll have to get
 right to work. In the first place, we must find out more
 about this ship, and just where it was sunk.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can do that part,&quot; said Mr. Sharp. &quot;I know some sea
 captains, and they can put me on the track of locating the
 exact spot. In fact, it might not be a bad idea to take an
 expert navigator with us. I can manage in the air all right,
 but I confess that working out a location under water is
 beyond me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, an old sea captain wouldn't be a bad idea, by any
 means,&quot; conceded Mr. Swift. &quot;Well, if you'll attend to that
 detail, Mr. Sharp, Tom, Mr. Jackson and I will finish the
 submarine. Most of the work is done, however, and it only
 remains to install the engine and motors. Now, in regard to
 the negative and positive electric plates, I'd like your
 opinion, Tom.&quot;</p>

<p>For Tom Swift was an inventor, second in ability only to
 his father, and his advice was often sought by his parent on
 matters of electrical construction, for the lad had made a
 specialty of that branch of science.</p>

<p>While father and son were deep in a discussion of the
 apparatus of the submarine, there will be an opportunity to
 make the reader a little better acquainted with them. Those
 of you who have read the previous volumes of this series do
 not need to be told who Tom Swift is. Others, however, may
 be glad to have a proper introduction to him.</p>

<p>Tom Swift lived with his father, Barton Swift, in the
 village of Shopton, New York. The Swift home was on the
 outskirts of the town, and the large house was surrounded by
 a number of machine shops, in which father and son, aided by
 Garret Jackson, the engineer, did their experimental and
 constructive work. Their house was not far from Lake
 Carlopa, a fairly large body of water, on which Tom often
 speeded his motor-boat.</p>

<p>In the first volume of this series, entitled &quot;Tom Swift
 and His Motor-Cycle,&quot; it was told how be became acquainted
 with Mr. Wakefield Damon, who suffered an accident while
 riding one of the speedy machines. The accident disgusted
 Mr. Damon with motor-cycles, and Tom secured it for a low
 price. He had many adventures on it, chief among which was
 being knocked senseless and robbed of a valuable patent
 model belonging to his father, which he was taking to
 Albany. The attack was committed by a gang known as the
 Happy Harry gang, who were acting at the instigation of a
 syndicate of rich men, who wanted to secure control of a
 certain patent turbine engine which Mr. Swift had invented.</p>

<p>Tom set out in pursuit of the thieves, after recovering
 from their attack, and had a strenuous time before he
 located them.</p>

<p>In the second volume, entitled &quot;Tom Swift and His Motor-
 Boat,&quot; there was related our hero's adventures in a fine
 craft which was recovered from the thieves and sold at
 auction. There was a mystery connected with the boat, and
 for a long time Tom could not solve it. He was aided,
 however, by his chum, Ned Newton, who worked in the Shopton
 Bank, and also by Mr. Damon and Eradicate Sampson, an aged
 colored whitewasher, who formed quite an attachment for Tom.</p>

<p>In his motor-boat Tom had more than one race with Andy
 Foger, a rich lad of Shopton, who was a sort of bully. He
 had red hair and squinty eyes, and was as mean in character
 as he was in looks. He and his cronies, Sam Snedecker and
 Pete Bailey, made trouble for Tom, chiefly because Tom
 managed to beat Andy twice in boat races.</p>

<p>It was while in his motor-boat, Arrow, that Tom formed the
 acquaintance of John Sharp, a veteran balloonist. While
 coming down Lake Carlopa on the way to the Swift home, which
 had been entered by thieves, Tom, his father and Ned Newton,
 saw a balloon on fire over the lake. Hanging from a trapeze
 on it was Mr. Sharp, who had made an ascension from a fair
 ground. By hard work on the part of Tom and his friends the
 aeronaut was saved, and took up his residence with the
 Swifts.</p>

<p>His advent was most auspicious, for Tom and his father
 were then engaged in perfecting an airship, and Mr. Sharp
 was able to lend them his skill, so that the craft was soon
 constructed.</p>

<p>In the third volume, called &quot;Tom Swift and His Airship,&quot;
 there was set down the doings of the young inventor, Mr.
 Sharp and Mr. Damon on a trip above the clouds. They
 undertook it merely for pleasure, but they encountered
 considerable danger, before they completed it, for they
 nearly fell into a blazing forest once, and were later fired
 at by a crowd of excited people. This last act was to effect
 their capture, for they were taken for a gang of bank
 robbers, and this was due directly to Andy Foger.</p>

<p>The morning after Tom and his friends started on their
 trip in the air, the Shopton Bank was found to have been
 looted of seventy-five thousand dollars. Andy Foger at once
 told the police that Tom Swift had taken the money, and when
 asked how he knew this, he said he had seen Tom hanging
 around the bank the night before the vault was burst open,
 and that the young inventor had some burglar tools in his
 possession. Warrants were at once sworn out for Tom and Mr.
 Damon, who was also accused of being one of the robbers, and
 a reward of five thousand dollars was offered.</p>

<p>Tom, Mr. Damon and Mr. Sharp sailed on, all unaware of
 this, and unable to account for being fired upon, until they
 accidentally read in the paper an account of their supposed
 misdeeds. They lost no time in starting back home, and on,
 the way got on the track of the real bank robbers, who were
 members of the Happy Harry gang.</p>

<p>How the robbers were captured in an exciting raid, how Tom
 recovered most of the stolen money, and how he gave Andy
 Foger a deserved thrashing for giving a false clue was told
 of, and there was an account of a race in which the Red
 Cloud (as the airship was called) took part, as well as
 details of how Tom and his friends secured the reward, which
 Andy Foger hoped to collect.</p>

<p>Those of you who care to know how the Red Cloud was
 constructed, and how she behaved in the air, even during
 accidents and when struck by lightning, may learn by reading
 the third volume, for the airship was one of the most
 successful ever constructed.</p>

<p>When the craft was finished, and the navigators were ready
 to start on their first long trip, Mr. Swift was asked to go
 with them. He declined, but would not tell why, until Tom,
 pressing him for an answer, learned that his father was
 planning a submarine boat, which he hoped to enter in some
 trials for Government prizes. Mr. Swift remained at home to
 work on this submarine, while his son and Mr. Sharp were
 sailing above the clouds.</p>

<p>On their return, however, and after the bank mystery had
 been cleared up, Tom and Mr. Sharp, aided Mr. Swift in
 completing the submarine, until, when the present story
 opens, it needed but little additional work to make the
 craft ready for the water.</p>

<p>Of course it had to be built near the sea, as it would
 have been impossible to transport it overland from Shopton.
 So, before the keel was laid, Mr. Swift rented a large
 cottage at a seaside place on the New Jersey coast and
 there, after, erecting a large shed, the work on the
 Advance, as the under-water ship was called, was begun.</p>

<p>It was soon to be launched in a large creek that extended
 in from the ocean and had plenty of water at high tide. Tom
 and Mr. Sharp made several trips back and forth from Shopton
 in their airship, to see that all was safe at home and
 occasionally to get needed tools and supplies from the
 shops, for not all the apparatus could be moved from Shopton
 to the coast.</p>

<p>It was when returning from one of these trips that Tom
 brought with him the paper containing an account of the
 wreck of the Boldero and the sinking of the treasure she
 carried.</p>

<p>Until late that night the three fortune-hunters discussed
 various matters.</p>

<p>&quot;We'll hurry work on the ship,&quot; said Mr. Swift it length.
 &quot;Tom, I wonder if your friend, Mr. Damon, would care to try
 how it seems under Water? He stood the air trip fairly
 well.&quot;</p>

<p>
 &quot;I'll write and ask him,&quot; answered the lad. &quot;I'm sure
 he'll go.&quot;</p>

<p>Securing, a few days later, the assistance of two
 mechanics, whom he knew he could trust, for as yet the
 construction of the Advance was a secret, Mr. Swift prepared
 to rush work on the submarine, and for the next three weeks
 there were busy times in the shed next to the seaside
 cottage. So busy, in fact, were Tom and Mr. Sharp, that
 they only found opportunity for one trip in the airship, and
 that was to get some supplies from the shops at home.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; remarked Mr. Swift one night, at the close of a
 hard day's work, &quot;another week will see our craft completed.
 Then we will put it in the water and see how it floats, and
 whether it submerges as I hope it does. But come on, Tom. I
 want to lock up. I'm very tired to-night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right, dad,&quot; answered the young inventor coming from
 the darkened rear of the shop. &quot;I just want to--&quot;</p>

<p>Ne paused suddenly, and appeared to be listening. Then he
 moved softly back to where he had come from.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter?&quot; asked his father in a whisper.
 &quot;What's up, Tom?&quot;</p>

<p>The lad did not answer Mr. Swift, with a worried look on
 his face, followed his son. Mr. Sharp stood in the door of
 the shop.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought I heard some one moving around back here,&quot; went
 on Tom quietly.</p>

<p>&quot;Some one in this shop!&quot; exclaimed the aged inventor
 excitedly. &quot;Some one trying to steal my ideas again! Mr.
 Sharp, come here! Bring that rifle! We'll teach these
 scoundrels a lesson!&quot;</p>

<p>Tom quickly darted hack to the extreme rear of the
 building. There was a scuffle, and the next minute Tom cried
 out:</p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ha! I beg your pardon,&quot; replied a voice. &quot;I am looking
 for Mr. Barton Swift.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My father,&quot; remarked Tom. &quot;But that's a queer place to
 look for him. He's up front. Father, here's a man who wishes
 to see you,&quot; he called.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I strolled in, and seeing no one about I went to the
 rear of the place,&quot; the voice went on. &quot;I hope I haven't
 transgressed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We were busy on the other side of the shop, I guess,&quot;
 replied Tom, and he looked suspiciously at the man who
 emerged from the darkness into the light from a window. &quot;I
 beg your pardon for grabbing you the way I did,&quot; went on the
 lad, &quot;but I thought you were one of a gang of men we've been
 having trouble with.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that's all right,&quot; continued the man easily. &quot;I know
 Mr. Swift, and I think he will remember me. Ah, Mr. Swift,
 how do you do?&quot; he added quickly, catching sight of Tom's
 father, who, with Mr. Sharp, was coming to meet the lad.</p>

<p>&quot;Addison Berg!&quot; exclaimed the aged inventor as he saw the
 man's face more plainly. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I came to see you,&quot; replied the man. &quot;May I have a talk
 with you privately?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I--I suppose so,&quot; assented Mr. Swift nervously. &quot;Come
 into the house.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Berg left Tom's side and advanced to where Mr. Swift
 was standing. Together the two emerged from the now fast
 darkening shop and went toward the house.</p>

<p>&quot;Who is he?&quot; asked Mr. Sharp of the young inventor in a
 whisper.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; replied the lad; &quot;but, whoever he is, dad
 seems afraid of him. I'm going to keep my eyes open.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<h2><a name="CH3" id="CH3">Chapter Three</a></h2>

<h3>Mr. Berg is Astonished</h3>

<p>
 Following his father and the stranger whom the aged
 inventor had addressed as Mr. Berg, Tom and Mr. Sharp
 entered the house, the lad having first made sure that
 Garret Jackson was on guard in the shop that contained the
 sub marine.</p>

<p>&quot;Now,&quot; said Mr. Swift to the newcomer, &quot;I am at your
 service. What is it you wish?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the first place, let me apologize for having startled
 you and your friends,&quot; began the man. &quot;I had no idea of
 sneaking into your workshop, but I had just arrived here,
 and seeing the doors open I went in. I heard no one about,
 and I wandered to the back of the place. There I happened to
 stumble over a board--&quot;</p>

<p>
 &quot;And I heard you,&quot; interrupted Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;Is this one of your employees?&quot; asked Mr. Berg in rather
 frigid tones.</p>

<p>&quot;That is my son,&quot; replied Mr. Swift.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I beg your pardon.&quot; The man's manner changed quickly.
 &quot;Well, I guess you did hear me, young man. I didn't intend
 to hark my shins the way I did, either. You must have taken
 me for a burglar or a sneak thief.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have been very much bothered by a gang of unscrupulous
 men,&quot; said Mr. Swift, &quot;and I suppose Tom thought it was some
 of them sneaking around again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's what I did,&quot; added the lad. &quot;I wasn't going to
 have any one steal the secret of the submarine if I could
 help it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite right! Quite right!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Berg. &quot;But my
 purpose was an open one. As you know, Mr. Swift, I represent
 the firm of Bentley &amp; Eagert, builders of submarine boats
 and torpedoes. They heard that you were constructing a craft
 to take part in the competitive prize tests of the United
 States Government, and they asked me to come and see you to
 learn when your ship would be ready. Ours is completed, but
 we recognize that it will be for the best interests of all
 concerned if there are a number of contestants, and my firm
 did not want to send in their entry until they knew that you
 were about finished with your ship. How about it? Are you
 ready to compete?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mr. Swift slowly. &quot;We are about ready. My
 craft needs a few finishing touches, and then it will be
 ready to launch.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then we may expect a good contest on your part,&quot;
 suggested Mr. Berg.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; began the aged inventor, &quot;I don't know about
 that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's that?&quot; exclaimed Mr. Berg.</p>

<p>&quot;I said I wasn't quite sure that we would compete,&quot; went
 on Mr. Swift. &quot;You see, when I first got this idea for a
 submarine boat I had it in mind to try for the Government
 prize of fifty thousand dollars.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's what we want, too,&quot; interrupted Mr. Berg with a
 smile.</p>

<p>&quot;But,&quot; went on Tom's father, &quot;since then certain matters
 have come up, and I think, on the whole, that we'll not
 compete for the prize after all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not compete for the prize?&quot; almost shouted the agent for
 Bentley &amp; Eagert. &quot;Why, the idea! You ought to compete. It
 is good for the trade. We think we have a very fine craft,
 and probably we would beat you in the tests, but--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wouldn't be too sure of that,&quot; put in Tom. &quot;You have
 only seen the outside of our boat. The inside is better
 yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, I have no doubt of that,&quot; spoke Mr. Berg, &quot;but we
 have been at the business longer than you have, and have had
 more experience. Still we welcome competition. But I am very
 much surprised that you are not going to compete for the
 prize, Mr. Swift. Very much surprised, indeed! You see, I
 came down from Philadelphia to arrange so that we could both
 enter our ships at the same time. I understand there is
 another firm of submarine boat builders who are going to try
 for the prize, and I want to arrange a date that will he
 satisfactory to all. I am greatly astonished that you are
 not going to compete.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we were going to,&quot; said Mr. Swift, &quot;only we have
 changed our minds, that's all. My son and I have other
 plans.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;May I ask what they are?&quot; questioned Mr. Berg.</p>

<p>&quot;You may,&quot; exclaimed Tom quickly; &quot;but I don't believe we
 can tell you. They're a secret,&quot; he added more cordially.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; retorted Mr. Berg. &quot;Well, of course I don't
 wish to penetrate any of your secrets, but I hoped we could
 contest together for the Government prize. It is worth
 trying for I assure you--fifty thousand dollars. Besides,
 there is the possibility of selling a number of submarines
 to the United States. It's a fine prize.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But the one we are after is a bigger one,&quot; Cried Tom
 impetuously, and the moment he had spoken the wished he
 could recall the words.</p>

<p>&quot;Eh? What's that?&quot; exclaimed Mr. Berg. &quot;You don't mean to
 say another government has offered a larger prize? If I had
 known that I would not have let my firm enter into the
 competition for the bonus offered by the United States.
 Please tell me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; went on Tom more soberly. &quot;I shouldn't have
 spoken. Mr. Berg, the plans of my father and myself are such
 that we can't reveal them now. We are going to try for a
 prize, but not in competition with you. It's an entirely
 different matter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I guess you'll find that the firm of Bentley &amp;
 Eagert are capable of trying for any prizes that are
 offered,&quot; boasted the agent. &quot;We may be competitors yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't believe so,&quot; replied Mr. Swift</p>

<p>&quot;We may,&quot; repeated Mr. Berg. &quot;And if we do, please
 remember that we will show no mercy. Our boats are the
 best.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And may the best boat win,&quot; interjected Mr. Sharp.
 &quot;That's all we ask. A fair field and no favors.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; spoke the agent coldly. &quot;Is this another son
 of yours?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;No but a good friend,&quot; replied the aged inventor. &quot;No,
 Mr. Berg, we won't compete this time. You may tell your firm
 so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very good,&quot; was the other's stiff reply. &quot;Then
 I will bid you good night. We shall carry off the
 Government prize, but permit me to add that I
 am very much astonished, very much indeed, that
 you do not try for the prize. From what I have
 seen of your submarine you have a very good
 one, almost as good, in some respects, as ours.
 I bid you good night,&quot; and with a bow the man
 left the room and hurried away from the house.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<h2><a name="CH4" id="CH4">Chapter Four</a></h2>

<h3>Tom is Imprisoned</h3>

<p> &quot;Well, I must say he's a cool one,&quot; remarked Tom, as the
 echoes of Mr. Berg's steps died away. &quot;The idea of thinking
 his boat better than ours! I don't like that man, dad. I'm
 suspicious of him. Do you think he came here to steal some
 of our ideas?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I hardly believe so, my son. But how did you discover
 him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just as you saw, dad. I heard a noise and went back there
 to investigate. I found him sneaking around, looking at the
 electric propeller plates. I went to grab him just as he
 stumbled over a hoard. At first I thought it was one of the
 old gang. I'm almost sure he was trying to discover
 something.&quot;</p>

<p>
 &quot;No, Tom. The firm he works for are good business men, and
 they would not countenance anything like that. They are
 heartless competitors, however, and if they saw a legitimate
 chance to get ahead of me and take advantage, they would do
 it. But they would not sneak in to steal my ideas. I feel
 sure of that. Besides, they have a certain type of submarine
 which they think is the best ever invented, and they would
 hardly change at this late day. They feel sure of winning
 the Government prize, and I'm just as glad we're not going
 to have a contest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think our boat is better than theirs?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Much better, in many respects.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't like that man Berg, though,&quot; went on Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;Nor do I,&quot; added his father. &quot;There is something strange
 about him. He was very anxious that I should compete.
 Probably he thought his firm's boat would go so far ahead of
 ours that they would get an extra bonus. But I'm glad he
 didn't see our new method of propulsion. That is the
 principal improvement in the Advance over other types of
 submarines. Well, another week and we will be ready for the
 test.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you known Mr. Berg long, dad?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not very. I met him in Washington when I was in the
 patent office. He was taking out papers on a submarine for
 his firm at the same time I got mine for the Advance. It is
 rather curious that he should come all the way here from
 Philadelphia, merely to see if I was going to compete. There
 is something strange about it, something that I can't
 understand.&quot;</p>

<p>The time was to come when Mr. Swift and his son were to
 get at the bottom of Mr. Berg's reasons, and they learned to
 their sorrow that he had penetrated some of their secrets.</p>

<p>Before going to bed that night Tom and Mr. Sharp paid a
 visit to the shed where the submarine was resting on the
 ways, ready for launching. They found Mr. Jackson on guard
 and the engineer said that no one had been around. Nor was
 anything found disturbed.</p>

<p>&quot;It certainly is a great machine,&quot; remarked the lad as he
 looked up at the cigar-shaped bulk towering over his head.
 &quot;Dad has outdone himself this trip.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It looks all right,&quot; commented Mr. Sharp. &quot;Whether it
 will work is another question.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, we can't tell until it's in the water,&quot; con ceded
 Tom. &quot;But I hope it does. Dad has spent much time and money
 on it.&quot;</p>

<p>The Advance was, as her name indicated, much in advance of
 previous submarines. There was not so much difference in
 outward construction as there was in the means of propulsion
 and in the manner in which the interior and the machinery
 were arranged.</p>

<p>The submarine planned by Mr. Swift and Tom jointly, and
 constructed by them, with the aid of Mr. Sharp and Mr.
 Jackson, was shaped like a Cigar, over one hundred feet long
 and twenty feet in diameter at the thickest part. It was
 divided into many compartments, all water-tight, so that if
 one or even three were flooded the ship would still be
 useable.</p>

<p>Buoyancy was provided for by having several tanks for the
 introduction of compressed air, and there was an emergency
 arrangement so that a collapsible aluminum container could
 be distended and filled with a powerful gas. This was to be
 used if, by any means, the ship was disabled on the bottom
 of the ocean. The container could be expanded and filled,
 and would send the Advance to the surface.</p>

<p>Another peculiar feature was that the engine-room, dynamos
 and other apparatus were all contained amidships. This gave
 stability to the craft, and also enabled the same engine to
 operate both shafts and propellers, as well as both the
 negative forward electrical plates, and the positive rear
 ones.</p>

<p>These plates were a new idea in submarine construction,
 and were the outcome of an idea of Mr. Swift, with some
 suggestions from his son.</p>

<p>The aged inventor did not want to depend on the usual
 screw propellers for his craft, nor did he want to use a jet
 of compressed air, shooting out from a rear tube, nor yet a
 jet of water, by means of which the creature called the
 squid shoots himself along. Mr. Swift planned to send the
 Advance along under water by means of electricity.</p>

<p>Certain peculiar plates were built at the forward and aft
 blunt noses of the submarine. Into the forward plate a
 negative charge of electricity was sent, and into the one at
 the rear a positive charge, just as one end of a horseshoe
 magnet is positive and will repel the north end of a compass
 needle, while the other pole of a magnet is negative and
 will attract it. In electricity like repels like, while
 negative and positive have a mutual attraction for each
 other.</p>

<p>Mr. Swift figured out that if he could send a powerful
 current of negative electricity into the forward plate it
 would pull the boat along, for water is a good conductor of
 electricity, while if a positive charge was sent into the
 rear plate it would serve to push the submarine along, and
 he would thus get a pulling and pushing motion, just as a
 forward and aft propeller works on some ferry boats.</p>

<p>But the inventor did not depend on these plates alone.
 There were auxiliary forward and aft propellers of the
 regular type, so that if the electrical plates did not work,
 or got out of order, the screws would serve to send the
 Advance along.</p>

<p>There was much machinery in the submarine There were
 gasolene motors, since space was too cramped to allow the
 carrying of coal for boilers. There were dynamos, motors and
 powerful pumps. Some of these were for air, and some for
 water. To sink the submarine below the surface large tanks
 were filled with water. To insure a more sudden descent,
 deflecting rudders were also used, similar to those on an
 airship. There were also special air pumps, and one for the
 powerful gas, which was manufactured on board.</p>

<p>Forward from the engine-room was a cabin, where meals
 could be served, and where the travelers could remain in the
 daytime. There was also a small cooking galley, or kitchen,
 there. Back of the engine-room were the sleeping quarters
 and the storerooms. The submarine was steered from the
 forward compartment, and here were also levers, wheels and
 valves that controlled all the machinery, while a number of
 dials showed in which direction they were going, how deep
 they were, and at what speed they were moving, as well as
 what the ocean pressure was.</p>

<p>On top, forward, was a small conning, or observation
 tower, with auxiliary and steering and controlling apparatus
 there. This was to be used when the ship was moving along
 on the surface of the ocean, or merely with the deck awash.
 There was a small flat deck surrounding the conning tower
 and this was available when the craft was on the surface.</p>

<p>There was provision made for leaving the ship when it was
 on the bed of the ocean. When it was desired to do this the
 occupants put on diving suits, which were provided with
 portable oxygen tanks. Then they entered a chamber into
 which water was admitted until it was equal in pressure to
 that outside. Then a steel door was opened, and they could
 step out. To re-enter the ship the operation was reversed.
 This was not a new feature. In fact, many submarines to-day
 use it.</p>

<p>At certain places there were thick bull's-eye windows, by
 means of which the under-water travelers could look out into
 the ocean through which they were moving. As a defense
 against the attacks of submarine monsters there was a steel,
 pointed ram, like a big harpoon. There were also a bow and a
 stern electrical gun, of which more will be told later.</p>

<p>In addition to ample sleeping accommodations, there were
 many conveniences aboard the Advance. Plenty of fresh water
 could be carried, and there was an apparatus for distilling
 more from the sea water that surrounded the travelers.
 Compressed air was carried in large tanks, and oxygen could
 be made as needed. In short, nothing that could add to the
 comfort or safety of the travelers had been omitted. There
 was a powerful crane and windlass, which had been installed
 when Mr. Swift thought his boat might be bought by the
 Government. This was to be used for raising wrecks or
 recovering objects from the bottom of the ocean. Ample
 stores and provisions were to be carried and, once the
 travelers were shut up in the Advance, they could exist for
 a month below the surface, providing no accident occurred.</p>

<p>All these things Tom and Mr. Sharp thought of as they
 looked over the ship before turning in for the night. The
 craft was made immensely strong to withstand powerful
 pressure at the bottom of the ocean. The submarine could
 penetrate to a depth of about three miles. Below that it was
 dangerous to go, as the awful force would crush the plates,
 powerful as they were.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we'll rush things to-morrow and the next day,&quot;
 observed Tom as he prepared to leave the building. &quot;Then
 we'll soon see if it works.&quot;</p>

<p>For the next week there were busy times in the shop near
 the ocean. Great secrecy was maintained, and though
 curiosity seekers did stroll along now and then, they
 received little satisfaction. At first Mr. Swift thought
 that the visit of Mr. Berg would have unpleasant results,
 for he feared that the agent would talk about the craft, of
 which he had so unexpectedly gotten a sight. But nothing
 seemed to follow from his chance inspection, and it was
 forgotten.</p>

<p>
 It was one evening, about a week later, that Tom was alone
 in the shop. The two mechanics that had been hired to help
 out in the rush had been let go, and the ship needed but a
 few adjustments to make it ready for the sea.</p>

<p>&quot;I think I'll just take another look at the water tank
 valves,&quot; said Tom to himself as he prepared to enter the big
 compartments which received the water ballast. &quot;I want to be
 sure they work properly and quickly. We've got to depend on
 them to make us sink when we want to, and, what's more
 important, to rise to the surface in a hurry. I've got time
 enough to look them over before dad and Mr. Sharp get back.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom entered the starboard tank by means of an emergency
 sliding door between the big compartments and the main part
 of the ship. This was closed by a worm and screw gear, and
 once the ship was in the water would seldom be used.</p>

<p>The young inventor proceeded with his task, carefully
 inspecting the valves by the light of a lantern he carried.
 The apparatus seemed to be all right, and Tom was about to
 leave when a peculiar noise attracted his attention. It was
 the sound of metal scraping on metal, and the lad's quick
 and well-trained ear told him it was somewhere about the
 ship.</p>

<p>He turned to leave the tank, but as he wheeled around his
 light flashed on a solid wall of steel back of him. The
 emergency outlet had been closed! He was a prisoner in the
 water compartment, and he knew, from past experience, that
 shout as he would, his voice could not be heard ten feet
 away. His father and Mr. Sharp, as he was aware, had gone to
 a nearby city for some tools, and Mr. Jackson, the engineer,
 was temporarily away. Mrs. Baggert, in the house, could not
 hear his cries.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm locked in!&quot; cried Tom aloud. &quot;The worm gear must have
 shut of itself. But I don't see how that could be. I've got
 to get out mighty soon, though, or I'll smother. This tank
 is airtight, and it won't take me long to breath up all the
 oxygen there is here. I must get that slide open.&quot;</p>

<p>He sought to grasp the steel plate that closed the
 emergency opening. His fingers slipped over the smooth,
 polished surface. He was hermetically sealed up--a captive!
 Blankly he set his lantern down and leaned hopelessly
 against the wall of the tank.</p>

<p>&quot;I've got to get out,&quot; he murmured.</p>

<p>As if in answer to him he heard a voice on the outside,
 crying:</p>

<p>&quot;There, Tom Swift! I guess I've gotten even with you now!
 Maybe next time you won't take a reward away from me, and
 lick me into the bargain. I've got you shut up good and
 tight, and you'll stay there until I get ready to let you
 out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Andy Foger!&quot; gasped Tom. &quot;Andy Foger sneaked in here and
 turned the gear. But how did he get to this part of the
 coast? Andy Foger, you let me out!&quot; shouted the young
 inventor; and as Andy's mocking laugh came to him faintly
 through the steel sides of the submarine, the imprisoned lad
 beat desperately with his hands on the smooth sides of the
 tank, vainly wondering how his enemy had discovered him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH5" id="CH5">Chapter Five</a></h2>

<h3>Mr. Berg is Suspicious</h3>

<p> Not for long did the young inventor endeavor to break his
 way out of the water-ballast tank by striking the heavy
 sides of it. Tom realized that this was worse than useless.
 He listened intently, but could hear nothing. Even the
 retreating footsteps of Andy Foger were inaudible.</p>

<p>&quot;This certainly is a pickle!&quot; exclaimed Tom aloud. &quot;I
 can't understand how he ever got here. He must have traced
 us after we went to Shopton in the airship the last time.
 Then he sneaked in here. Probably he saw me enter, but how
 could he knew enough to work the worm gear and close the
 door? Andy has had some experience with machinery, though,
 and one of the vaults in the bank where his father is a
 director closed just like this tank. That's very likely how
 he learned about it. But I've got to do something else
 besides thinking of that sneak, Andy. I've got to get out of
 here. Let's see if I can work the gear from inside.&quot;</p>

<p>
 Before he started, almost, Tom knew that it would be
 impossible. The tank was made to close from the interior of
 the submarine, and the heavy door, built to withstand the
 pressure of tons of water, could not be forced except by the
 proper means.</p>

<p>&quot;No use trying that,&quot; concluded the lad, after a tiring
 attempt to force back the sliding door with his hands. &quot;I've
 got to call for help.&quot;</p>

<p>He shouted until the vibrations in the confined space made
 his ears ring, and the mere exertion of raising his voice to
 the highest pitch made his heart beat quickly. Yet there
 came no response. He hardly expected that there would be
 any, for with his father and Mr. Sharp away, the engineer
 absent on an errand, and Mrs. Baggert in the house some
 distance off, there was no one to hear his calls for help,
 even if they had been capable of penetrating farther than
 the extent of the shed, where the under-water craft had been
 constructed.</p>

<p>&quot;I've got to wait until some of them come out here,&quot;
 thought Tom. &quot;They'll be sure to release me and make a
 search. Then it will be easy enough to call to them and tell
 them where I am, once they are inside the shed. But--&quot; He
 paused, for a horrible fear came over him. &quot;Suppose they
 should come--too late?&quot; The tank was airtight. There was
 enough air in it to last for some time, but, sooner or
 later, it would no longer support life. Already, Tom
 thought, it seemed oppressive, though probably that was his
 imagination.</p>

<p>&quot;I must get out!&quot; he repeated frantically. &quot;I'll die in
 here soon.&quot;</p>

<p>Again he tried to shove back the steel door. Then he
 repeated his cries until be was weary. No one answered him.
 He fancied once he could hear footsteps in the shed, and
 thought, perhaps, it was Andy, come back to gloat over him.
 Then Tom knew the red-haired coward would not dare venture
 back. We must do Andy the justice to say that he never
 realized that he was endangering Tom's life. The bully had
 no idea the tank was airtight when he closed it. He had seen
 Tom enter and a sudden whim came to him to revenge himself.</p>

<p>But that did not help the young inventor any. There was no
 doubt about it now--the air was becoming close. Tom had been
 imprisoned nearly two hours, and as he was a healthy, strong
 lad, he required plenty of oxygen. There was certainly less
 than there had been in the tank. His head began to buzz, and
 there was a ringing in his ears.</p>

<p>Once more he fell upon his knees, and his fingers sought
 the small projections of the gear on the inside of the door
 He could no more budge the mechanism than a child could open
 a burglar-proof vault.</p>

<p>&quot;It's no use,&quot; he moaned, and he sprawled at full length
 on the floor of the tank, for there the air was purer. As he
 did so his fingers touched something. He started as they
 closed around the handle of a big monkey wrench. It was one
 he had brought into the place with him. Imbued with new hope
 be struck a match and lighted his lantern, which he had
 allowed to go out as it burned up too much of the oxygen. By
 the gleam of it he looked to see if there were any bolts or
 nuts he could loosen with the wrench, in order to slide the
 door back. It needed but a glance to show him the futility
 of this.</p>

<p>&quot;It's no go,&quot; he murmured, and he let the wrench fall to
 the floor. There was a ringing, clanging sound, and as it
 smote his ears Tom sprang up with an exclamation.</p>

<p>&quot;That's the thing!&quot; he cried. &quot;I wonder I didn't think of
 it before. I can signal for help by pounding on the sides of
 the tank with the wrench. The blows will carry a good deal
 farther than my voice would.&quot; Every one knows how far the
 noise of a boiler shop, with hammers falling on steel
 plates, can be heard; much farther than can a human voice.</p>

<p>Tom began a lusty tattoo on the metal sides of the tank.
 At first he merely rattled out blow after blow, and then, as
 another thought came to him, he adopted a certain plan. Some
 time previous, when he and Mr. Sharp had planned their trip
 in the air, the two had adopted a code of signals. As it was
 difficult in a high wind to shout from one end of the
 airship to the other, the young inventor would sometimes
 pound on the pipe which ran from the pilot house of the Red
 Cloud to the engine-room. By a combination of numbers,
 simple messages could be conveyed. The code included a call
 for help. Forty-seven was the number, but there had never
 been any occasion to use it.</p>

<p>Tom remembered this now. At once he ceased his
 indiscriminate hammering, and began to beat out regularly--
 one, two, three, four--then a pause, and seven blows would
 be given. Over and over again he rang out this number--forty
 seven--the call for help.</p>

<p>&quot;If Mr. Sharp only comes back he will hear that, even in
 the house,&quot; thought poor Tom &quot;Maybe Garret or Mrs. Baggert
 will hear it, too, but they won't know what it means.
 They'll think I'm just working on the submarine.&quot;</p>

<p>It seemed several hours to Tom that he pounded out that
 cry for aid, but, as he afterward learned, it was only a
 little over an hour. Signal after signal he sent vibrating
 from the steel sides of the tank. When one arm tired he
 would use the other. He grew weary, his head was aching, and
 there was a ringing in his ears; a ringing that seemed as if
 ten thousand bells were jangling out their peals, and he
 could barely distinguish his own pounding.</p>

<p>Signal after signal he sounded. It was becoming like a
 dream to him, when suddenly, as he paused for a rest, he
 heard his name called faintly, as if far away.</p>

<p>&quot;Tom! Tom! Where are you?&quot;</p>

<p>It was the voice of Mr. Sharp. Then followed the tones of
 the aged inventor.</p>

<p>&quot;My poor boy! Tom, are you still alive?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, dad! In the starboard tank!&quot; the lad gasped out, and
 then he lost his senses. When he revived he was lying on a
 pile of bagging in the submarine shop, and his father and
 the aeronaut were bending over him.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you all right, Tom?&quot; asked Mr. Swift.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes--I--I guess so,&quot; was the hesitating answer. &quot;Yes,&quot;
 the lad added, as the fresh air cleared his head. &quot;I'll be
 all right pretty soon. Have you seen Andy Foger?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did he shut you in there?&quot; demanded Mr. Swift.</p>

<p>Tom nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll have him arrested!&quot; declared Mr. Swift &quot;I'll go to
 town as soon as you're in good shape again and notify the
 police.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, don't,&quot; pleaded Tom. &quot;I'll take care of Andy myself.
 I don't really believe he knew how serious it was. I'll
 settle with him later, though.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it came mighty near being serious,&quot; remarked Mr.
 Sharp grimly. &quot;Your father and I came back a little sooner
 than we expected, and as soon as I got near the house I
 heard your signal. I knew what it was in a moment. There
 were Mrs. Baggert and Garret talking away, and when I asked
 them why they didn't answer your call they said they thought
 you were merely tinkering with the machinery. But I knew
 better. It's the first time we ever had a use for 'forty-
 seven,' Tom.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I hope it will be the last,&quot; replied the young
 inventor with a faint smile. &quot;But I'd like to know what Andy
 Foger is doing in this neighborhood.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom was soon himself again and able to go to the house,
 where he found Mrs. Baggert brewing a big basin of catnip
 tea, under the impression that it would in some way be good
 for his. She could not forgive herself for not having
 answered his signal, and as for Mr. Jackson, he had started
 for a doctor as soon as he learned that Tom was shut up in
 the tank. The services of the medical man were canceled by
 telephone, as there was no need for him, and the engineer
 came back to the house.</p>

<p>Tom was fully himself the next day, and aided his father
 and Mr. Sharp in putting the finishing touches to the
 Advance. It was found that some alteration was required in
 the auxiliary propellers, and this, much to the regret of
 the young inventor, would necessitate postponing the trial a
 few days.</p>

<p>&quot;But we'll have her in the water next Friday.&quot; promised
 Mr. Swift.</p>

<p>&quot;Aren't you superstitious about Friday?&quot; asked the
 balloonist.</p>

<p>&quot;Not a bit of it,&quot; replied the aged inventor. &quot;Tom,&quot; he
 added, &quot;I wish you would go in the house and get me the roll
 of blueprints you'll find on my desk.&quot;</p>

<p>As the lad neared the cottage he saw, standing in front of
 the place, a small automobile. A man had just descended
 from it, and it needed but a glance to show that he was Mr.
 Addison Berg.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, good morning, Mr. Swift,&quot; greeted Mr. Berg. &quot;I wish
 to see your father, but as I don't wish to lay myself open
 to suspicions by entering the shop, perhaps you will ask him
 to step here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; answered the lad, wondering why the agent had
 returned. Getting the blueprints, and asking Mr. Berg to sit
 down on the porch, Tom delivered the message.</p>

<p>&quot;You come back with me, Tom,&quot; said his father. &quot;I want you
 to be a witness to what he says. I'm not going to get into
 trouble with these people.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Berg came to the point at once.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Swift,&quot; he said, &quot;I wish you would reconsider your
 determination not to enter the Government trials. I'd like
 to see you compete. So would my firm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is no use going over that again,&quot; replied the aged
 inventor. &quot;I have another object in view now than trying for
 the Government prize. What it is I can't say, but it may
 develop in time--if we are successful,&quot; and he looked at
 his son, smiling the while.</p>

<p>Mr. Berg tried to argue, but it was of no avail Then he
 changed his manner, and said:</p>

<p>&quot;Well, since you won't, you won't, I suppose. I'll go back
 and report to my firm. Have you anything special to do this
 morning?&quot; he went on to Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I can always find something to keep me busy,&quot;
 replied the lad, &quot;but as for anything special--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought perhaps you'd like to go for a trip in my
 auto,&quot; interrupted Mr. Berg. &quot;I had asked a young man who is
 stopping at the same hotel where I am to accompany me, but
 he has unexpectedly left, and I don't like to go alone. His
 name was--let me see. I have a wretched memory for names,
 but it was something like Roger or Moger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Foger!&quot; cried Tom. &quot;Was it Andy Foger?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that was it. Why, do you know him?&quot; asked Mr. Berg
 in some surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;I should say so,&quot; replied Tom. &quot;He was the cause of what
 might have resulted in something serious for me,&quot; and the
 lad explained about being imprisoned in the tank.</p>

<p>&quot;You don't tell me!&quot; cried Mr. Berg. &quot;I had no idea he was
 that kind of a lad. You see, his father is one of the
 directors of the firm by whom I am employed. Andy came from
 home to spend a few weeks at the seaside, and stopped at the
 same hotel that I did. He went off yesterday afternoon, and
 I haven't seen him since, though he promised to go for a
 ride with me. He must have come over here and entered your
 shop unobserved. I remember now he asked me where the
 submarine was being built that was going to compete with our
 firm's, and I told him. I didn't think he was that kind of
 a lad. Well, since he's probably gone back home, perhaps you
 will come for a ride with me, Tom.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid I can't go, thank you,&quot; answered the lad. &quot;We
 are very busy getting our submarine in shape for a trial.
 But I can imagine why Andy left so hurriedly. He probably
 learned that a doctor had been summoned for me, though, as
 it happened, I didn't need one. But Andy probably got
 frightened at what he had done, and left. I'll make him
 more sorry, when I meet him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't blame you a bit,&quot; commented Mr. Berg. &quot;Well, I must
 be getting back.&quot;</p>

<p>He hastened out to his auto, while Tom and his father
 watched the agent.</p>

<p>&quot;Tom, never trust that man,&quot; advised the aged inventor
 solemnly.</p>

<p>&quot;Just what I was about to remark,&quot; said his son. &quot;Well,
 let's get back to work. Queer that he should come here
 again, and it's queer about Andy Foger.&quot;</p>

<p>Father and son returned to the machine shop, while Mr.
 Berg puffed away in his auto. A little later, Tom having
 occasion to go to a building near the boundary line of the
 cottage property which his father had hired for the season,
 saw, through the hedge that bordered it, an automobile
 standing in the road. A second glance showed him that it was
 Mr. Berg's machine. Something had gone wrong with it, and
 the agent had alighted to make an adjustment.</p>

<p>The young inventor was close to the man, though the latter
 was unaware of his presence.</p>

<p>&quot;Hang it all!&quot; Tom heard Mr. Berg exclaim to himself. &quot;I
 wonder what they can be up to? They won't enter the
 Government contests, and they won't say why. I believe
 they're up to some game, and I've got to find out what it
 is. I wonder if I couldn't use this Foger chap?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He seems to have it in for this Tom Swift,&quot; Mr. Berg went
 on, still talking to himself, though not so low but that Tom
 could hear him. &quot;I think I'll try it. I'll get Andy Foger to
 sneak around and find out what the game is. He'll do it, I
 know.&quot;</p>

<p>By this time the auto was in working order again, and the
 agent took his seat and started off.</p>

<p>&quot;So that's how matters lie, eh?&quot; thought Tom. &quot;Well, Mr.
 Berg, we'll be doubly on the lookout for you after this. As
 for Andy Foger, I think I'll make him wish he'd never locked
 me in that tank. So you expect to find out our 'game,' eh,
 Mr. Berg? Well, when you do know it, I think it will
 astonish you. I only hope you don't learn what it is until
 we get at that sunken treasure, though.&quot;</p>

<p>But alas for Tom's hopes. Mr. Berg did learn of the object
 of the treasure-seekers, and sought to defeat them, as we
 shall learn as our story proceeds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH6" id="CH6">Chapter Six</a></h2>

<h3>Turning the Tables</h3>

<p> When the young inventor informed his father what he had
 overheard Mr. Berg saying, the aged inventor was not as much
 worried as his son anticipated.</p>

<p>&quot;All we'll have to do, Tom,&quot; he said, &quot;is to keep quiet
 about where we are going. Once we have the Advance afloat,
 and try her out, we can start on our voyage for the South
 American Coast and search for the sunken treasure. When we
 begin our voyage under water I defy any one to tell where we
 are going, or what our plans are. No, I don't believe we
 need worry about Mr. Berg, though he probably means
 mischief.&quot;</p>

<p>
 &quot;Well, I'm going to keep my eyes open for him and Andy
 Foger,&quot; declared Tom.</p>

<p>The days that followed were filled with work. Not only
 were there many unexpected things to do about the submarine,
 but Mr. Sharp was kept busy making inquiries about the
 sunken treasure ship. These inquiries had to be made
 carefully, as the adventurers did not want their plans
 talked of, and nothing circulates more quickly than rumors
 of an expedition after treasure of any kind.</p>

<p>&quot;What about the old sea captain you were going to get to
 go with us?&quot; asked Mr. Swift of the balloonist one
afternoon.
 &quot;Have you succeeded in finding one yet?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; I am in communication with a man think will be just
 the person for us. His name is Captain Alden Weston, and he
 has sailed all over the world. He has also taken part in
 more than one revolution, and, in fact, is a soldier of
 fortune. I do not know him personally, but a friend of mine
 knows him, and says he will serve us faithfully. I have
 written to him, and he will he here in a few days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's good. Now about the location of the wreck itself.
 Have you been able to learn any more details?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, not many. You see, the Boldero was abandoned in a
 storm, and the captain did not take very careful
 observations. As nearly as it can be figured out the
 treasure ship went to the bottom in latitude forty-five
 degrees south, and longitude twenty-seven east from
 Washington. That's a pretty indefinite location, but I hope,
 once we get off the Uruguay coast, we can better it. We can
 anchor or lay outside the harbor, and in the small boat we
 carry go ashore and possibly gain more details. For it was
 at Montevideo that the shipwrecked passengers and sailors
 landed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does Captain Weston know our object?&quot; inquired Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;No, and I don't propose to tell him until we are ready to
 start,&quot; replied Mr. Sharp. &quot;I don't know just how he'll
 consider a submarine trip after treasure, but if I spring it
 on him suddenly he's less likely to back out. Oh, I think
 he'll go.&quot;</p>

<p>Somewhat unexpectedly the next day it was discovered that
 certain tools and appliances were needed for the submarine,
 and they had been left in the house at Shopton, where
 Eradicate Sampson was in charge as caretaker during the
 absence of Mr. Swift and his son and the housekeeper.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I suppose we'll have to go back after them,&quot;
 remarked Tom. &quot;We'll take the airship, dad, and make a two-
 days' trip of it. Is there anything else you want?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you might bring a bundle of papers you'll find in
 the lower right hand drawer of my desk. They contain some
 memoranda I need.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom and Mr. Sharp had become so used to traveling in the
 airship that it seemed no novelty to them, though they
 attracted much attention wherever they went. They soon had
 the Red Cloud in readiness for a flight, and rising in the
 air above the shop that contained the powerful submarine, a
 craft utterly different in type from the aeroplane, the nose
 of the airship was pointed toward Shopton.</p>

<p>They made a good flight and landed near the big shed where
 the bird of the air was kept. It was early evening when they
 got to the Swift homestead, and Eradicate Sampson was glad
 to see them.</p>

<p>Eradicate was a good cook, and soon had a meal ready for
 the travelers. Then, while Mr. Sharp selected the tools and
 other things needed, and put them in the airship ready for
 the start back the next morning, Tom concluded he would take
 a stroll into Shopton, to see if he could see his friend,
 Ned Newton. It was early evening, and the close of a
 beautiful day, a sharp shower in the morning having cooled
 the air.</p>

<p>Tom was greeted by a number of acquaintances as he
 strolled along, for, since the episode of the bank robbery,
 when he had so unexpectedly returned with the thieves and
 the cash, the lad was better known than ever.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess Ned must be home&quot; thought our hero as he looked
 in vain for his chum among the throng on the streets. &quot;I've
 got time to take a stroll down to his house.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom was about to cross the street when he was startled by
 the sound of an automobile horn loudly blown just at his
 side. Then a voice called:</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, there! Git out of the way if you don't want to be
 run over!&quot;</p>

<p>He looked up, and saw a car careening along. At the wheel
 was the red-haired bully, Andy Foger, and in the tonneau
 were Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey.</p>

<p>&quot;Git out of the way,&quot; added Sam, and he grinned
 maliciously at Tom.</p>

<p>The latter stepped back, well out of the path of the car,
 which was not moving very fast. Just in front of Tom was a
 puddle of muddy water. There was no necessity for Andy
 steering into it, but he saw his opportunity, and a moment
 later one of the big pneumatic tires had plunged into the
 dirty fluid, spattering it all over Tom, some even going as
 high as his face.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha! ha!&quot; laughed Andy. &quot;Maybe you'll get out of my way
 next time, Tom Swift.&quot;</p>

<p>The young inventor was almost speechless from righteous
 anger. He wiped the mud from his face, glanced down at his
 clothes, which were all but ruined, and called out:</p>

<p>&quot;Hold on there, Andy Foger! I want to see you!&quot; for he
 thought of the time when Andy had shut him in the tank.</p>

<p>&quot;Ta! ta!&quot; shouted Pete Bailey.</p>

<p>&quot;See you later,&quot; added Sam.</p>

<p>&quot;Better go home and take a bath, and then sail away in
 your submarine,&quot; went on Andy. &quot;I'll bet it will sink.&quot;</p>

<p>Before Tom could reply the auto had turned a corner.
 Disgusted and angry, he tried to sop up some of the muddy
 water with his handkerchief. While thus engaged he heard his
 name called, and looked up to see Ned Newton.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter? Fall down?&quot; asked his chum.</p>

<p>&quot;Andy Foger,&quot; replied Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;That's enough,&quot; retorted Ned. &quot;I can guess the rest.
 We'll have to tar and feather him some day, and ride him out
 of town on a rail. I'd kick him myself, only his father is a
 director in the bank where I work, and I'd be fired if I
 did. Can't afford any such pleasure. But some day I'll give
 Andy a good trouncing, and then resign before they can
 discharge me. But I'll be looking for another job before I
 do that. Come on to my house, Tom, and I'll help you clean
 up.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom was a little more presentable when he left his chum's
 residence, after spending the evening there, but he was
 still burning for revenge against Andy and his cronies. He
 had half a notion to go to Andy's house and tell Mr. Foger
 how nearly serious the bully's prank at the sub marine had
 been, but be concluded that Mr. Foger could only uphold his
 son. &quot;No, I'll settle with him myself,&quot; decided Tom.</p>

<p>Bidding Eradicate keep a watchful eye about the house, and
 leaving word for Mr. Damon to be sure to come to the coast
 if he again called at the Shopton house, Tom and Mr. Sharp
 prepared to make their return trip early the next morning.</p>

<p>The gas tank was filled and the Red Cloud arose in the
 air. Then, with the propellers moving at moderate speed, the
 nose of the craft was pointed toward the New Jersey coast.</p>

<p>A few miles out from Shopton, finding there was a contrary
 wind in the upper regions where they were traveling, Mr.
 Sharp descended several hundred feet. They were moving over
 a sparsely settled part of the country, and looking down,
 Tom saw, speeding along a highway, an automobile.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder who's in it?&quot; he remarked, taking down a
 telescope and peering over the window ledge of the cabin.
 The next moment he uttered a startled exclamation.</p>

<p>&quot;Andy Foger, Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey!&quot; he cried.
 &quot;Oh, I wish I had a bucket of water to empty on them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know a better way to get even with them than that,&quot;
 said Mr. Sharp.</p>

<p>&quot;How?&quot; asked Tom eagerly.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll show you,&quot; replied the balloonist. &quot;It's a trick I
 once played on a fellow who did me an injury. Here, you
 steer for a minute until I get the thing fixed, then I'll
 take charge.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Sharp went to the storeroom and came back with a long,
 stout rope and a small anchor of four prongs. It was carried
 to be used in emergencies, but so far had never been called
 into requisition. Fastening the grapple to the cable, the
 balloonist said:</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Tom, they haven't seen you. You stand in the stern
 and pay out the rope. I'll steer the airship, and what I
 want you to do is to catch the anchor in the rear of their
 car. Then I'll show you some fun.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom followed instructions. Slowly he lowered the rope with
 the dangling grapple. The airship was also sent down, as the
 cable was not quite long enough to reach the earth from the
 height at which they were. The engine was run at slow speed,
 so that the noise would not attract the attention of the
 three cronies who were speeding along, all unconscious of
 the craft in the air over their heads. The Red Cloud was
 moving in the same direction as was the automobile.</p>

<p>The anchor was now close to the rear of Andy's car.
 Suddenly it caught on the tonneau and Tom called that fact
 to Mr. Sharp.</p>

<p>&quot;Fasten the rope at the cleat,&quot; directed the balloonist.</p>

<p>Tom did so, and a moment later the aeronaut sent the
 airship up by turning more gas into the container. At the
 same time he reversed the engine and the Red Cloud began
 pulling the touring car backward, also lifting the rear
 wheels clear from the earth.</p>

<p>A startled cry from the occupants of the machine told Tom
 and his friend that Andy and his cronies were aware
 something was wrong. A moment later Andy, looking up, saw
 the airship hovering in the air above him. Then he saw the
 rope fast to his auto. The airship was not rising now, or
 the auto would have been turned over, but it was slowly
 pulling it backward, in spite of the fact that the motor of
 the car was still going.</p>

<p>&quot;Here! You let go of me!&quot; cried Andy. &quot;I'll have you
 arrested if you damage my car.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come up here and cut the rope.&quot; called Tom leaning over
 and looking down. He could enjoy the bully's discomfiture.
 As for Sam and Pete, they were much frightened, and cowered
 down on the floor of the tonneau.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe you'll shut me in the tank again and splash mud on
 me!&quot; shouted Tom.</p>

<p>The rear wheels of the auto were lifted still higher from
 the ground, as Mr. Sharp turned on a little more gas. Andy
 was not proof against this.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! oh!&quot; he cried. &quot;Please let me down, Tom. I'm awful
 sorry for what I did! I'll never do it again! Please, please
 let me down! Don't You'll tip me over!&quot;</p>

<p>He had shut off his motor now, and was frantically
 clinging to the steering wheel.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you admit that you're a sneak and a coward?&quot; asked
 Tom, &quot;rubbing it in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes! Oh, please let me down!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shall we?&quot; asked Tom of Mr. Sharp.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the balloonist. &quot;We can afford to lose the
 rope and anchor for the sake of turning the tables. Cut the
 cable.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom saw what was intended. Using a little hatchet, he
 severed the rope with a single blow. With a crash that could
 be heard up in the air where the Red Cloud hovered, the rear
 wheels of the auto dropped to the ground. Then came two loud
 reports.</p>

<p>&quot;Both tires busted!&quot; commented Mr. Sharp dryly, and Tom,
 looking down, saw the trio of lads ruefully contemplating
 the collapsed rubber of the rear wheels. The tables had been
 effectually turned on Andy Foger. His auto was disabled, and
 the airship, with a graceful sweep, mounted higher and
 higher, continuing on its way to the coast.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH7" id="CH7">Chapter Seven</a></h2>

<h3>Mr. Damon Will Go</h3>

<p> &quot;Well, I guess they've had their lesson,&quot; remarked Tom, as
 he took an observation through the telescope and saw Andy
 and his cronies hard at work trying to repair the ruptured
 tires. &quot;That certainly was a corking good trick.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; admitted Mr. Sharp modestly. &quot;I once did something
 similar, only it was a horse and wagon instead of an auto.
 But let's try for another speed record. The conditions are
 just right.&quot;</p>

<p>
 They arrived at the coast much sooner than they had dared
 to hope, the Red Cloud proving herself a veritable wonder.</p>

<p>The remainder of that day, and part of the next, was spent
 in working on the submarine.</p>

<p>&quot;We'll launch her day after to-morrow,&quot; declared Mr. Swift
 enthusiastically. &quot;Then to see whether my calculations are
 right or wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It won't be your fault if it doesn't work,&quot; said his son.
 &quot;You certainly have done your best.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And so have you and Mr. Sharp and the others, for that
 matter. Well, I have no doubt but that everything will be
 all right, Tom.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Sharp the next morning, as he was
 adjusting a certain gage. &quot;I knew I'd forget something. That
 special brand of lubricating oil. I meant to bring it from
 Shopton, and I didn't.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe I can get it in Atlantis,&quot; suggested Tom, naming
 the coast city nearest to them. &quot;I'll take a walk over. It
 isn't far.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will you? I'll be glad to have you,&quot; resumed the
 balloonist. &quot;A gallon will be all we'll need.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom was soon on his way. He had to walk, as the roads were
 too poor to permit him to use the motor-cycle, and the
 airship attracted too much attention to use on a short trip.
 He was strolling along, when from the other side of a row of
 sand dunes, that lined the uncertain road to Atlantis, he
 heard some one speaking. At first the tones were not
 distinct, but as the lad drew nearer to the voice he heard
 an exclamation.</p>

<p>&quot;Bless my gold-headed cane! I believe I'm lost. He said it
 was out this way somewhere, bet I don't see anything of it.
 If I had that Eradicate Sampson here now I'd--bless my
 shoelaces I don't know what I would do to him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Damon! Mr. Damon!&quot; cried Tom. &quot;Is that you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me? Of course it's me! Who else would it be?&quot; answered
 the voice. &quot;But who are you. Why, bless my liver! If it
 isn't Tom Swift!&quot; he cried. &quot;Oh, but I'm glad to see you! I
 was afraid I was shipwrecked! Bless my gaiters, how are you,
 anyhow? How is your father? How is Mr. Sharp, and all the
 rest of them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pretty well. And you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me? Oh, I'm all right; only a trifle nervous. I called at
 your house in Shopton yesterday, and Eradicate told me, as
 well as he could, where you were located. I had nothing to
 do, so I thought I'd take a run down here. But what's this I
 hear about you? Are you going on a voyage?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the air? May I go along again? I certainly enjoyed my
 other trip in the Red Cloud. What is, all but the fire and
 being shot at. May I go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We're going on a different sort of trip this time,&quot; said
 the youth.</p>

<p>&quot;Where?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Under water.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Under water? Bless my sponge bath! You don't mean it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Dad has completed the submarine he was working on
 when we were off in the airship, and it will be launched the
 day after to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that's so. I'd forgotten about it. He's going to try
 for the Government prize, isn't he? But tell me more about
 it. Bless my scarf-pin, but I'm glad I met you! Going into
 town, I take it. Well, I just came from there, but I'll walk
 back with you. Do you think--is there any possibility--that
 I could go with you? Of course, I don't want to crowd you,
 but--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, there'll be plenty of room,&quot; replied the young
 inventor. &quot;In fact, more room than we had in the airship. We
 were talking only the other day about the possibility of you
 going with us, but we didn't think you'd risk it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Risk it? Bless my liver! Of course I'll risk' it! It
 can't be as bad as sailing in the air. You can't fall,
 that's certain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; but maybe you can't rise,&quot; remarked Tom grimly.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, we won't think of that. Of course, I'd like to go. I
 fully expected to be killed in the Red Cloud, but as I
 wasn't I'm ready to take a chance in the water. On the
 whole, I think I prefer to be buried at sea, anyhow. Now,
 then, will you take me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think I can safely promise,&quot; answered Tom with a smile
 at his friend's enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The two were approaching the city, having walked along as
 they talked. There were still some sand dunes near the road,
 and they kept on the side of these, nearest the beach, where
 they could watch the breakers.</p>

<p>&quot;But you haven't told me where you are going,&quot; went on Mr.
 Damon, after blessing a few dozen objects. &quot;Where do the
 Government trials take place?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; replied the lad, &quot;to be frank with you, we have
 abandoned our intention of trying for the Government prize.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not going to try for it? Bless my slippers! Why not?
 Isn't fifty thousand dollars worth striving for? And, with
 the kind of a submarine you say you have, you ought to be
 able to win.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, probably we could win,&quot; admitted the young inventor,
 &quot;but we are going to try for a better prize.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A better one? I don't understand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sunken treasure,&quot; explained Tom. &quot;There's a ship sunk off
 the coast of Uruguay, with three hundred thousand dollars in
 gold bullion aboard. Dad and I are going to try to recover
 that in our submarine. We're going to start day after
 to-morrow, and, if you like, you may go along.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go along! Of course I'll go along!&quot; cried the eccentric
 man. &quot;But I never heard of such a thing. Sunken treasure!
 Three hundred thousand dollars in gold! My, what a lot of
 money! And to go after it in a submarine! It's as good as a
 story!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, we hope to recover all the treasure,&quot; said the lad.
 &quot;We ought to be able to claim at least half of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bless my pocketbook!&quot; cried Mr. Damon, but Tom did not
 hear him. At that instant his attention was attracted by
 seeing two men emerge from behind the sand dune near which
 he and Mr. Damon had halted momentarily, when the youth
 explained about the treasure. The man looked sharply at Tom.
 A moment later the first man was joined by another, and at
 the sight of him our hero could not repress an exclamation
 of alarm. For the second man was none other than Addison
 Berg.</p>

<p>The latter glanced quickly at Tom, and then, with a hasty
 word to his companion, the two swung around and made off in
 the opposite direction to that in which they had been
 walking.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter?&quot; asked Mr. Damon, seeing the young
 inventor was strangely affected.</p>

<p>&quot;That--that man,&quot; stammered the lad.</p>

<p>&quot;You don't mean to tell me that was one the Happy Harry
 gang, do you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. But one, or both of those men, may prove to be worse.
 That second man was Addison Berg, and he's agent for a firm
 of submarine boat builders who are rivals of dad's. Berg has
 been trying to find out why we abandoned our intention of
 competing for the Government prize.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope you didn't tell him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't intend to,&quot; replied Tom, smiling grimly, &quot;but
 I'm afraid I have, however He certainly overheard what I
 said. I spoke too loud. Yes, he must have heard me. That's
 why he hurried off so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Possibly no harm is done. You didn't give the location of
 the sunken ship.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; but I guess from what I said it will be easy enough
 to find. Well, if we're going to have a fight for the
 possession of that sunken gold, I'm ready for it. The
 Advance is well equipped for a battle. I must tell dad of
 this. It's my fault.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And partly mine, for asking you such leading questions in
 a public place,&quot; declared Mr. Damon. &quot;Bless my coat-tails,
 but I'm sorry! Maybe, after all, those men were so
 interested in what they themselves were saying that they
 didn't understand what you said.&quot;</p>

<p>But if there had been any doubts on this score they would
 have been dissolved had Tom and his friend been able to see
 the actions of Mr. Berg and his companion a little later.
 The plans of the treasure-hunters had been revealed to their
 ears.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH8" id="CH8">Chapter Eight</a></h2>

<h3>Another Treasure Expedition</h3>

<p> While Tom and Mr. Damon continued on to Atlantis after the
 oil, the young inventor lamenting from time to time that his
 remarks about the real destination of the Advance had been
 overheard by Mr. Berg, the latter and his companion were
 hastening back along the path that ran on one side of the
 sand dunes.</p>

<p>&quot;What's your hurry?&quot; asked Mr. Maxwell, who was with the
 submarine agent. &quot;You turned around as if you were shot when
 you saw that man and the lad. There didn't appear to be any
 cause for such a hurry. From what I could hear they were
 talking about a submarine. You're in the same business. You
 might be friends.&quot;</p>

<p>
 &quot;Yes, we might,&quot; admitted Mr. Berg with a peculiar smile;
 &quot;but, unless I'm very much mistaken, we're going to be
 rivals.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rivals? What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't tell you now. Perhaps I may later. But if you
 don't mind, walk a little faster, please. I want to get to a
 long-distance telephone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have just overheard something that I wish to
 communicate to my employers, Bentley &amp; Eagert.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Overheard something? I don't see what it could be, unless
 that lad--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll learn in good time,&quot; went on the submarine agent.
 &quot;But I must telephone at once.&quot;</p>

<p>A little later the two men had reached a trolley line that
 ran into Atlantis, and they arrived at the city before Mr.
 Damon and Tom got there, as the latter had to go by a
 circuitous route. Mr. Berg lost no time in calling up his
 firm by telephone.</p>

<p>&quot;I have had another talk with Mr. Swift,&quot; he reported to
 Mr. Bentley, who came to the instrument in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what does he say?&quot; was the impatient question. &quot;I
 can't understand his not wanting to try for the Government
 prize. It is astonishing. You said you were going to
 discover the reason, Mr Berg, but you haven't done so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, the reason Mr. Swift and his son don't care to try
 for the fifty thousand dollar prize is that they are after
 one of three hundred thousand dollars.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Three hundred thousand dollars!&quot; cried Mr. Bentley. &quot;What
 government is going to offer such a prize as that for
 submarines, when they are getting almost as common as
 airships? We ought to have a try for that ourselves. What
 government is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No government at all. But I think we ought to have a try
 for it, Mr. Bentley.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Explain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I have just learned, most accidentally, that the
 Swifts are going after sunken treasure--three hundred
 thousand dollars in gold bullion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sunken treasure? Where?</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know exactly, but off the coast of Uruguay,&quot; and
 Mr. Berg rapidly related what he had overheard Tom tell Mr.
 Damon. Mr. Bentley was much excited and impatient for more
 details, but his agent could not give them to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; concluded the senior member of the firm of
 submarine boat builders, &quot;if the Swifts are going after
 treasure, so can we. Come to Philadelphia at once, Mr. Berg,
 and we'll talk this matter over. There is no time to lose.
 We can afford to forego the Government prize for the chance
 of getting a much larger one. We have as much right to
 search for the sunken gold as the Swifts have. Come here at
 once, and we will make our plans.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; agreed the agent with a smile as he hung up
 the receiver. &quot;I guess,&quot; he murmured to himself, &quot;that you
 won't be so high and mighty with me after this, Tom Swift.
 We'll see who has the best boat, after all. We'll have a
 contest and a competition, but not for a government prize.
 It will be for the sunken gold.&quot;</p>

<p>It was easy to see that Mr. Berg was much pleased with
 himself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tom and Mr. Damon had reached Atlantis, and had
 purchased the oil. They started back, but Tom took a street
 leading toward the center of the place, instead of striking
 for the beach path, along which they had come.</p>

<p>&quot;Where are you going?&quot; asked Mr. Damon.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to see if that Andy Foger has come back here,&quot;
 replied the lad, and he told of having been shut in the tank
 by the bully.</p>

<p>&quot;I've never properly punished him for that trick,&quot; he went
 on, &quot;though we did manage to burst his auto tires. I'm
 curious to know how he knew enough to turn that gear and
 shut the tank door. He must have been loitering near the
 shop, seen me go in the submarine alone, watched his chance
 and sneaked in after me. But I'd like to get a complete
 explanation, and if I once got hold of Andy I could make him
 talk,&quot; and Tom clenched his fist in a manner that augured no
 good for the squint-eyed lad. &quot;He was stopping at the same
 hotel with Mr. Berg, and be hurried away after the trick he
 played on me. I next saw him in Shopton, but I thought
 perhaps he might have come back here. I'm going to inquire
 at the hotel,&quot; he added.</p>

<p>Andy's name was not on the register since his hasty
 flight, however, and Tom, after inquiring from the clerk and
 learning that Mr. Berg was still a guest at the hostelry,
 rejoined Mr. Damon.</p>

<p>&quot;Bless my hat!&quot; exclaimed that eccentric individual as
 they started back to the lonely beach where the submarine
 was awaiting her advent into the water. &quot;The more I think
 of the trip I'm going to take, the more I like it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope you will,&quot; remarked Tom. &quot;It will be a new
 experience for all of us. There's only one thing worrying
 me, and that is about Mr. Berg having overheard what I
 said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, don't worry about that. Can't we slip away and leave
 no trace in the water?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope so, but I must tell dad and Mr. Sharp about what
 happened.&quot;</p>

<p>The aged inventor was not a little alarmed at what his son
 related, but he agreed with Mr. Damon, whom he heartily
 welcomed, that little was to be apprehended from Berg and
 his employers.</p>

<p>&quot;They know we're after a sunken wreck, but that's all they
 do know,&quot; said Tom's father. &quot;We are only waiting for the
 arrival of Captain Alden Weston, and then we will go. Even
 if Bentley &amp; Eagert make a try for the treasure we'll
have
 the start of them, and this will be a case of first come,
 first served. Don't worry, Tom. I'm glad you're going, Mr
 Damon. Come, I will show you our submarine.&quot;</p>

<p>As father and son, with their guest, were going to the
 machine shop, Mr. Sharp met them. He had a letter in his
 hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Good news!&quot; the balloonist cried. &quot;Captain Weston will be
 with us to-morrow. He will arrive at the Beach Hotel in
 Atlantis, and wants one of us to meet him there. He has
 considerable information about the wreck.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Beach Hotel,&quot; murmured Tom. &quot;That is where Mr. Berg
 is stopping. I hope he doesn't worm any of our secret from
 Captain Weston,&quot; and it was with a feeling of uneasiness
 that the young inventor continued after his father and Mr.
 Damon to where the submarine was.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH9" id="CH9">Chapter Nine</a></h2>

<h3>Captain Weston's Advent</h3>

<p> &quot;Bless my water ballast, but that certainly is a fine boat!&quot;
 cried Mr. Damon, when he had been shown over the new craft.
 &quot;I think I shall feel even safer in that than in the Red
Cloud.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, don't go back on the airship!&quot; exclaimed Mr Sharp. &quot;I
 was counting on taking you on another trip.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, maybe after we get back from under the ocean,&quot;
 agreed Mr. Damon. &quot;I particularly like the cabin
 arrangements of the Advance. I think I shall enjoy myself.&quot;</p>

<p>
 He would be hard to please who could not take pleasure
 from a trip in the submarine. The cabin was particularly
 fine, and the sleeping arrangements were good.</p>

<p>More supplies could be carried than was possible on the
 airship, and there was more room in which to cook and serve
 food. Mr. Damon was fond of good living, and the kitchen
 pleased him as much as anything else.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Tom set out for Atlantis, to meet
 Captain Weston at the hotel. The young inventor inquired of
 the clerk whether the seafaring man had arrived, and was
 told that he had come the previous evening.</p>

<p>&quot;Is he in his room?&quot; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; answered the clerk with a peculiar grin. &quot;He's an
 odd character. Wouldn't go to bed last night until we had
 every window in his room open, though it was blowing quite
 hard, and likely to storm. The captain said he was used to
 plenty of fresh air. Well, I guess he got it, all right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where is he now?&quot; asked the youth, wondering what sort of
 an individual he was to meet.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, he was up before sunrise, so some of the scrubwomen
 told me. They met him coming from his room, and he went
 right down to the beach with a big telescope he always
 carries with him. He hasn't come back yet. Probably he's
 down on the sand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hasn't he had breakfast?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. He left word he didn't want to eat until about four
 bells, whatever time that is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's ten o'clock,&quot; replied Tom, who had been studying up
 on sea terms lately. &quot;Eight bells is eight o'clock in the
 morning, or four in the afternoon or eight at night,
 according to the time of day. Then there's one bell for
 every half hour, so four bells this morning would be ten
 o'clock in this watch, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that's the way it goes, eh?&quot; asked the clerk. &quot;I
 never could get it through my head. What is twelve o'clock
 noon?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's eight bells, too; so is twelve o'clock midnight.
 Eight bells is as high as they go on a ship. But I guess
 I'll go down and see if I can meet the captain. It will soon
 be ten o'clock, or four bells, and he must be hungry for
 breakfast. By the way, is that Mr. Berg still here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; he went away early this morning. He and Captain
 Weston seemed to strike up quite an acquaintance, the night
 clerk told me. They sat and smoked together until long after
 midnight, or eight bells,&quot; and the clerk smiled as he
 glanced down at the big diamond ring on his little finger.</p>

<p>&quot;They did?&quot; fairly exploded Tom, for he had visions of
 what the wily Mr. Berg might worm out of the simple captain.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Why, isn't the captain a proper man to make friends
 with?&quot; and the clerk looked at Tom curiously.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes, of course,&quot; was the hasty answer. &quot;I guess I'll
 go and see if I can find him--the captain, I mean.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom hardly knew what to think. He wished his father, or
 Mr. Sharp, had thought to warn Captain Weston against
 talking of the wreck. It might be too late now.</p>

<p>The young inventor hurried to the beach, which was not far
 from the hotel. He saw a solitary figure pacing up and down,
 and from the fact that the man stopped, every now and then,
 and gazed seaward through a large telescope, the lad
 concluded it was the captain for whom he was in search. He
 approached, his footsteps making no sound on the sand. The
 man was still gazing through the glass.</p>

<p>&quot;Captain Weston?&quot; spoke Tom.</p>

<p>Without a show of haste, though the voice must have
 startled him, the captain turned. Slowly he lowered the
 telescope, and then he replied softly:</p>

<p>&quot;That's my name. Who are you, if I may ask?&quot;</p>

<p>Tom was struck, more than by anything else, by the gentle
 voice of the seaman. He had prepared himself, from the
 description of Mr. Sharp, to meet a gruff, bewhiskered
 individual, with a voice like a crosscut saw, and a rolling
 gait. Instead he saw a man of medium size, with a smooth
 face, merry blue eyes, and the softest voice and gentlest
 manner imaginable. Tom was very much disappointed. He had
 looked for a regular sea-dog, and he met a landsman, as he
 said afterward. But it was not long before our hero changed
 his mind regarding Captain Weston.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm Tom Swift,&quot; the owner of that name said, &quot;and I have
 been sent to show you the way to where our ship is ready to
 launch.&quot; The young inventor refrained from mentioning
 submarine, as it was the wish of Mr Sharp to disclose this
 feature of the voyage to the sailor himself.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha, I thought as much,&quot; resumed the captain quietly.
 &quot;It's a fine day, if I may be permitted to say so,&quot; and he
 seemed to hesitate, as if there was some doubt whether or
 not he might make that observation.</p>

<p>&quot;It certainly is,&quot; agreed the lad. Then, with a smile he
 added: &quot;It is nearly eight bells.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ha!&quot; exclaimed the captain, also smiling, but even his
 manner of saying &quot;Ha!&quot; was less demonstrative than that of
 most persons. &quot;I believe I am getting hungry, if I may be
 allowed the remark,&quot; and again he seemed asking Tom's pardon
 for mentioning the fact.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps you will come back to the cabin and have a little
 breakfast with me,&quot; he went on. &quot;I don't know what sort of a
 galley or cook they have aboard the Beach Hotel, but it
 can't be much worse than some I've tackled.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, thank you,&quot; answered the youth. &quot;I've had my
 breakfast. But I'll wait for you, and then I'd like to get
 back. Dad and Mr. Sharp are anxious to meet you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I am anxious to meet them, if you don't mind me
 mentioning it,&quot; was the reply, as the captain once more put
 the spyglass to his eye and took an observation. &quot;Not many
 sails in sight this morning,&quot; he added. &quot;But the weather is
 fine, and we ought to get off in good shape to hunt for the
 treasure about which Mr. Sharp wrote me. I believe we are
 going after treasure,&quot; he said; &quot;that is, if you don't mind
 talking about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not in the least,&quot; replied Tom quickly, thinking this a
 good opportunity for broaching a subject that was worrying
 him. &quot;Did you meet a Mr. Berg here last night, Captain
 Weston?&quot; he went on.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Mr. Berg and I had quite a talk. He is a well-
 informed man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did he mention the sunken treasure?&quot; asked the lad, eager
 to find out if his suspicions were true.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, he did, if you'll excuse me putting it so plainly,&quot;
 answered the seaman, as if Tom might be offended at so
 direct a reply. But the young inventor was soon to learn
 that this was only an odd habit with the seaman.</p>

<p>&quot;Did he want to know where the wreck of the Boldero was
 located?&quot; continued the lad. &quot;That is, did he try to
 discover if you knew anything about it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mr. Weston, &quot;he did. He pumped me, if you are
 acquainted with that term, and are not offended by it. You
 see, when I arrived here I made inquiries as to where your
 father's place was located. Mr. Berg overheard me, and
 introduced himself as agent for a shipbuilding concern. He
 was very friendly, and when he said he knew you and your
 parent, I thought he was all right.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom's heart sank. His worst fears were to be realized, he
 thought.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, he and I talked considerable, if I may be permitted
 to say so,&quot; went on the captain. &quot;He seemed to know about
 the wreck of the Boldero, and that she had three hundred
 thousand dollars in gold aboard. The only thing he didn't
 know was where the wreck was located. He knew it was off
 Uruguay somewhere, but just where he couldn't say. So he
 asked me if I knew, since he must have concluded that I was
 going with you on the gold-hunting expedition.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you do know, don't you?&quot; asked Tom eagerly.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I have it pretty accurately charted out, if you
 will allow me that expression,&quot; was the calm answer. &quot;I took
 pains to look it up at the request of Mr. Sharp.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And he wanted to worm that information out of you?&quot;
 inquired the youth excitedly.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I'm afraid he did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you give him the location?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; remarked the captain, as he took another
 observation before closing up the telescope, &quot;you see, while
 we were talking, I happened to drop a copy of a map I'd
 made, showing the location of the wreck. Mr. Berg picked it
 up to hand to me, and he looked at it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; cried Tom. &quot;Then he knows just where the treasure
 is, and he may get to it ahead of us. It's too bad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; continued the seaman calmly, &quot;Mr. Berg picked up
 that map, and he looked very closely at the latitude and
 longitude I had marked as the location of the wreck.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then he won't have any trouble finding it,&quot; murmured our
 hero.</p>

<p>&quot;Eh? What's that?&quot; asked the captain, &quot;if I may be
 permitted to request you to repeat what you said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I say he won't have any trouble locating the sunken
 Boldero,&quot; repeated Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but I think he will, if he depends on that map,&quot; was
 the unexpected reply. &quot;You see,&quot; explained Mr. Weston, &quot;I'm
 not so simple as I look. I sensed what Mr. Berg was after,
 the minute he began to talk to me. So I fixed up a little
 game on him. The map which I dropped on purpose, not
 accidentally, where he would see it, did have the location
 of the wreck marked. Only it didn't happen to be the right
 location. It was about five hundred miles out of the way,
 and I rather guess if Mr. Berg and his friends go there for
 treasure they'll find considerable depth of water and quite
 a lonesome spot. Oh, no, I'm not as easy as I look, if you
 don't mind me mentioning that fact; and when a scoundrel
 sets out to get the best of me, I generally try to turn the
 tables on him. I've seen such men as Mr. Berg before. I'm
 afraid, I'm very much afraid, the sight he had of the fake
 map I made won't do him much good. Well, I declare, it's
 past four bells. Let's go to breakfast, if you don't mind me
 asking you,&quot; and with that the captain started off up the
 beach, Tom following, his ideas all a whirl at the unlooked-for
 outcome of the interview.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH10" id="CH10">Chapter Ten</a></h2>

<h3>Trial of the Submarine</h3>

<p> Tom felt such a relief at hearing of Captain Weston's ruse
 that his appetite, sharpened by an early breakfast and the
 sea air, came to him with a rush, and he had a second
 morning meal with the odd sea captain, who chuckled heartily
 when he thought of how Mr Berg had been deceived.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; resumed Captain Weston, over his bacon and eggs, &quot;I
 sized him up for a slick article as soon as I laid eyes on
 him. But he evidently misjudged me, if I may be permitted
 that term. Oh, well, we may meet again, after we secure the
 treasure, and then I can show him the real map of the
 location of the wreck.&quot;</p>

<p>
 &quot;Then you have it?&quot; inquired the lad eagerly.</p>

<p>Captain Weston nodded, before hiding his face behind a
 large cup of coffee; his third, by the way.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me see it?&quot; asked Tom quickly. The captain set down
 his cup. He looked carefully about the hotel dining-room.
 There were several guests, who, like himself, were having a
 late breakfast.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a good plan,&quot; the sailor said slowly, &quot;when you're
 going into unknown waters, and don't want to leave a wake
 for the other fellow to follow, to keep your charts locked
 up. If it's all the same to you,&quot; he added diffidently, &quot;I'd
 rather wait until we get to where your father and Mr. Sharp
 are before displaying the real map. I've no objection to
 showing you the one Mr. Berg saw,&quot; and again he chuckled.</p>

<p>The young inventor blushed at his indiscretion. He felt
 that the news of the search for the treasure had leaked out
 through him, though he was the one to get on the trail of it
 by seeing the article in the paper. Now he had nearly been
 guilty of another break. He realized that he must be more
 cautious. The captain saw his confusion, and said:</p>

<p>&quot;I know how it is. You're eager to get under way. I don't
 blame you. I was the same myself when I was your age. But
 we'll soon be at your place, and then I'll tell you all I
 know. Sufficient now, to say that I believe I have located
 the wreck within a few miles. I got on the track of a sailor
 who had met one of the shipwrecked crew of the Boldero, and
 he gave me valuable information. Now tell me about the
 craft we are going in. A good deal depends on that.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom hardly knew what to answer. He recalled what Mr. Sharp
 had said about not wanting to tell Captain Weston, until
 the last moment, that they were going in a submarine, for
 fear the old seaman (for he was old in point of service
 though not in years) might not care to risk an under-water
 trip. Therefore Tom hesitated. Seeing it, Captain Weston
 remarked quietly:</p>

<p>&quot;I mean, what type is your submarine? Does it go by
 compressed air, or water power?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How do you know it's a submarine?&quot; asked the young
 inventor quickly, and in some confusion.</p>

<p>&quot;Easy enough. When Mr. Berg thought he was pumping me, I
 was getting a lot of information from him. He told me about
 the submarine his firm was building, and, naturally, he
 mentioned yours. One thing led to another until I got a
 pretty good idea of your craft. What do you call it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Advance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good name. I like it, if you don't mind speaking of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We were afraid you wouldn't like it,&quot; commented Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;What, the name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, the idea of going in a submarine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; and Captain Weston laughed. &quot;Well, it takes more
 than that to frighten me, if you'll excuse the expression.
 I've always had a hankering to go under the surface, after
 so many years spent on top. Once or twice I came near going
 under, whether I wanted to or not, in wrecks, but I think I
 prefer your way. Now, if you're all done, and don't mind me
 speaking of it, I think we'll start for your place. We must
 hustle, for Berg may yet get on our trail, even if he has
 got the wrong route,&quot; and he laughed again.</p>

<p>It was no small relief to Mr Swift and Mr. Sharp to learn
 that Captain Weston had no objections to a submarine, as
 they feared he might have. The captain, in his diffident
 manner, made friends at once with the treasure-hunters, and
 he and Mr. Damon struck up quite an acquaintance. Tom told
 of his meeting with the seaman, and the latter related, with
 much gusto, the story of how he had fooled Mr. Berg.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, perhaps you'd like to come and take a look at the
 craft that is to be our home while we're beneath the water,&quot;
 suggested Mr. Swift and the sailor assenting, the aged
 inventor, with much pride, assisted by Tom, pointed out on
 the Advance the features of interest. Captain Weston gave
 hearty approval, making one or two minor suggestions, which
 were carried out.</p>

<p>&quot;And so you launch her to-morrow,&quot; he concluded, when he
 had completed the inspection &quot;Well, I hope it's a success,
 if I may be permitted to say so.&quot;</p>

<p>There were busy times around the machine shop next day. So
 much secrecy had been maintained that none of the residents,
 or visitors to the coast resort, were aware that in their
 midst was such a wonderful craft as the submarine. The last
 touches were put on the under-water ship; the ways, leading
 from the shop to the creek, were well greased, and all was
 in readiness for the launching. The tide would soon be at
 flood, and then the boat would slide down the timbers (at
 least, that was the hope of all), and would float in the
 element meant to receive her. It was decided that no one
 should be aboard when the launching took place, as there was
 an element of risk attached, since it was not known just how
 buoyant the craft was. It was expected she would float,
 until the filled tanks took her to the bottom, but there was
 no telling.</p>

<p>&quot;It will be flood tide now in ten minutes,&quot; remarked
 Captain Weston quietly, looking at his watch. Then he took
 an observation through the telescope. &quot;No hostile ships
 hanging in the offing,&quot; he reported. &quot;All is favorable, if
 you don't mind me saying so,&quot; and he seemed afraid lest his
 remark might give offense.</p>

<p>&quot;Get ready,&quot; ordered Mr. Swift. &quot;Tom, see that the ropes
 are all clear,&quot; for it had been decided to ease the Advance
 down into the water by means of strong cables and
 windlasses, as the creek was so narrow that the submarine,
 if launched in the usual way, would poke her nose into the
 opposite mud bank and stick there.</p>

<p>&quot;All clear,&quot; reported the young inventor.</p>

<p>&quot;High tide!&quot; exclaimed the captain a moment later,
 snapping shut his watch.</p>

<p>&quot;Let go!&quot; ordered Mr. Swift, and the various windlasses
 manned by the inventor, Tom and the others began to unwind
 their ropes. Slowly the ship slid along the greased ways.
 Slowly she approached the water. How anxiously they all
 watched her! Nearer and nearer her blunt nose, with the
 electric propulsion plate and the auxiliary propeller, came
 to the creek, the waters of which were quiet now, awaiting
 the turn of the tide.</p>

<p>Now little waves lapped the steel sides. It was the first
 contact of the Advance with her native element.</p>

<p>&quot;Pay out the rope faster!&quot; cried Mr. Swift.</p>

<p>The windlasses were turned more quickly Foot by foot the
 craft slid along until, with a final rush, the stern left
 the ways and the submarine was afloat. Now would come the
 test. Would she ride on an even keel, or sink out of sight,
 or turn turtle? They all ran to the water's edge, Tom in the
 lead.</p>

<p>&quot;Hurrah!&quot; suddenly yelled the lad, trying to stand on his
 head. &quot;She floats! She's a success! Come on! Let's get
 aboard!&quot;</p>

<p>For, true enough, the Advance was riding like a duck on
 the water. She had been proportioned just right, and her
 lines were perfect. She rode as majestically as did any ship
 destined to sail on the surface, and not intended to do
 double duty.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, we must moor her to the pier,&quot; directed Mr.
 Sharp. &quot;The tide will turn in a few minutes and take her out
 to sea.&quot;</p>

<p>He and Tom entered a small boat, and soon the submarine
 was tied to a small dock that had been built for the
 purpose.</p>

<p>&quot;Now to try the engine,&quot; suggested Mr. Swift, who was
 almost trembling with eagerness; for the completion of the
 ship meant much to him.</p>

<p>&quot;One moment,&quot; begged Captain Weston. &quot;If you don't mind,
 I'll take an observation,&quot; he went on, and he swept the
 horizon with his telescope. &quot;All clear,&quot; he reported. &quot;I
 think we may go aboard and make a trial trip.&quot;</p>

<p>Little time was lost in entering the cabin and engine-room,
 Garret Jackson accompanying the party to aid with the
 machinery. It did not take long to start the motors, dynamos
 and the big gasolene engine that was the vital part of the
 craft. A little water was admitted to the tanks for ballast,
 since the food and other supplies were not yet on board. The
 Advance now floated with the deck aft of the conning tower
 showing about two feet above the surface of the creek. Mr.
 Swift and Tom entered the pilot house.</p>

<p>&quot;Start the engines,&quot; ordered the aged inventor, &quot;and we'll
 try my new system of positive and negative electrical
 propulsion.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a hum and whir in the body of the ship beneath
 the feet of Tom and his father. Captain Weston stood on the
 little deck near the conning tower.</p>

<p>&quot;All ready?&quot; asked the youth through the
 speaking tube to Mr. Sharp and Mr. Jackson in
 the engine-room.</p>

<p>&quot;All ready,&quot; came the answer.</p>

<p>Tom threw over the connecting lever, while his father
 grasped the steering wheel. The Advance shot forward, moving
 swiftly along, about half submerged.</p>

<p>&quot;She goes! She goes!&quot; cried Tom</p>

<p>&quot;She certainly does, if I may be permitted to say so,&quot; was
 the calm contribution of Captain Weston. &quot;I congratulate
 you.&quot;</p>

<p>Faster and faster went the new craft. Mr. Swift headed her
 toward the open sea, but stopped just before passing out of
 the creek, as he was not yet ready to venture into deep
 water.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to test the auxiliary propellers,&quot; he said. After
 a little longer trial of the electric propulsion plates,
 which were found to work satisfactorily, sending the
 submarine up and down the creek at a fast rate, the screws,
 such as are used on most submarines, were put into gear.
 They did well, but were not equal to the plates, nor was so
 much expected of them.</p>

<p>&quot;I am perfectly satisfied,&quot; announced Mr. Swift as he once
 more headed the boat to sea. &quot;I think, Captain Weston, you
 had better go below now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because I am going to completely submerge the craft. Tom,
 close the conning tower door. Perhaps you will come in here
 with us, Captain Weston, though it will be rather a tight
 fit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, I will. I want to see how it feels to be in a
 pilot house under water.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom closed the water-tight door of the conning tower. Word
 was sent through the tube to the engine-room that a more
 severe test of the ship was about to be made. The craft was
 now outside the line of breakers and in the open sea.</p>

<p>&quot;Is everything ready, Tom?&quot; asked his father in a quiet
 voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Everything,&quot; replied the lad nervously, for the
 anticipation of being about to sink below the surface was
 telling on them all, even on the calm, old sea captain.</p>

<p>&quot;Then open the tanks and admit the water,&quot; ordered Mr.
 Swift.</p>

<p>His son turned a valve and adjusted some levers. There was
 a hissing sound, and the Advance began sinking. She was
 about to dive beneath the surface of the ocean, and those
 aboard her were destined to go through a terrible experience
 before she rose again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH11" id="CH11">Chapter Eleven</a></h2>

<h3>On the Ocean Bed</h3>

<p> Lower and lower sank the submarine. There was a swirling
 and foaming of the water as she went down, caused by the air
 bubbles which the craft carried with her in her descent.
 Only the top of the conning tower was out of water now, the
 ocean having closed over the deck and the rounded back of
 the boat. Had any one been watching they would have imagined
 that an accident was taking place.</p>

<p>
 In the pilot house, with its thick glass windows, Tom, his
 father and Captain Weston looked over the surface of the
 ocean, which every minute was coming nearer and nearer to
 them.</p>

<p>&quot;We'll be all under in a few seconds,&quot; spoke Tom in a
 solemn voice, as he listened to the water hissing into the
 tanks.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and then we can see what sort of progress we will
 make,&quot; added Mr. Swift. &quot;Everything is going fine, though,&quot;
 he went on cheerfully. &quot;I believe I have a good boat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is no doubt of it in my mind,&quot; remarked Captain
 Weston, and Tom felt a little disappointed that the sailor
 did not shout out some such expression as &quot;Shiver my
 timbers!&quot; or &quot;Keel-haul the main braces, there, you lubber!&quot;
 But Captain Weston was not that kind of a sailor, though his
 usually quiet demeanor could be quickly dropped on
 necessity, as Tom learned later.</p>

<p>A few minutes more and the waters closed over the top of
 the conning tower. The Advance was completely submerged.
 Through the thick glass windows of the pilot house the
 occupants looked out into the greenish water that swirled
 about them; but it could not enter. Then, as the boat went
 lower, the light from above gradually died out, and the
 semi-darkness gave place to gloom.</p>

<p>&quot;Turn on the electrics and the searchlight, Tom,&quot; directed
 his father.</p>

<p>There was the click of a switch, and the conning tower was
 flooded with light. But as this had the effect of
 preventing the three from peering out into the water, just
 as one in a lighted room cannot look out into the night, Tom
 shut them off and switched on the great searchlight. This
 projected its powerful beams straight ahead and there, under
 the ocean, was a pathway of illumination for the treasure-
 seekers.</p>

<p>&quot;Fine!&quot; cried Captain Weston, with more enthusiasm than he
 had yet manifested. &quot;That's great, if you don't mind me
 mentioning it. How deep are we?&quot;</p>

<p>Tom glanced at a gage on the side of the pilot tower.</p>

<p>&quot;Only about sixty feet,&quot; he answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Then don't go any deeper!&quot; cried the captain hastily. &quot;I
 know these waters around here, and that's about all the
 depth you've got. You'll be on the bottom in a minute.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I intend to get on the bottom after a while,&quot; said Mr.
 Swift, &quot;but not here. I want to try for a greater distance
 under water before I come to rest on the ocean's bed. But I
 think we are deep enough for a test. Tom, close the tank
 intake pipes and we'll see how the Advance will progress
 when fully submerged.&quot;</p>

<p>The hissing stopped, and then, wishing to see how the
 motors and other machinery would work, the aged inventor and
 his son, accompanied by Captain Weston, descended from the
 conning tower, by means of an inner stairway, to the
 interior of the ship. The submarine could be steered and
 managed from below or above. She was now floating about
 sixty-five feet below the surface of the bay.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, how do you like it?&quot; asked Tom of Mr. Damon, as he
 saw his friend in an easy chair in the living-room or main
 cabin of the craft, looking out of one of the plate-glass
 windows on the side.</p>

<p>&quot;Bless my spectacles, it's the most wonderful thing I ever
 dreamed of!&quot; cried the queer character, as he peered at the
 mass of water before him. &quot;To think that I'm away down under
 the surface, and yet as dry as a bone. Bless my necktie, but
 it's great! What are we going to do now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go forward,&quot; replied the young inventor.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps I had better make an observation,&quot; suggested
 Captain Weston, taking his telescope from under his arm,
 where he had carried it since entering the craft, and
 opening it. &quot;We may run afoul of something, if you don't
 mind me mentioning such a disagreeable subject.&quot; Then, as he
 thought of the impossibility of using his glass under water,
 he closed it.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall have little use for this here, I'm afraid,&quot; he
 remarked with a smile. &quot;Well, there's some consolation.
 We're not likely to meet many ships in this part of the
 ocean. Other vessels are fond enough of remaining on the
 surface. I fancy we shall have the depths to ourselves,
 unless we meet a Government submarine, and they are hardly
 able to go as deep as we can. No, I guess we won't run into
 anything and I can put this glass away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Unless we run into Berg and his crowd,&quot; suggested Tom in
 a low voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha! ha!&quot; laughed Captain Weston, for he did not want Mr.
 Swift to worry over the unscrupulous agent. &quot;No, I don't
 believe we'll meet them, Tom. I guess Berg is trying to work
 out the longitude and latitude I gave him. I wish I could
 see his face when he realizes that he's been deceived by
 that fake map.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I hope he doesn't discover it too soon and trail
 us,&quot; went on the lad. &quot;But they're going to start the
 machinery now. I suppose you and I had better take charge of
 the steering of the craft. Dad will want to be in the
 engine-room.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; replied the captain, and he moved forward
 with the lad to a small compartment, shut off from the
 living-room, that served as a pilot house when the conning
 tower was not used. The same levers, wheels and valves were
 there as up above, and the submarine could be managed as
 well from there as from the other place.</p>

<p>&quot;Is everything all right?&quot; asked Mr Swift as he went into
 the engine-room, where Garret Jackson and Mr. Sharp were
 busy with oil cans.</p>

<p>&quot;Everything,&quot; replied the balloonist. &quot;Are you going to
 start now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, we're deep enough for a speed trial. We'll go out to
 sea, however, and try for a lower depth record, as soon as
 there's enough water. Start the engine.&quot;</p>

<p>A moment later the powerful electric currents were flowing
 into the forward and aft plates, and the Advance began to
 gather way, forging through the water.</p>

<p>&quot;Straight ahead, out to sea, Tom,&quot; called his father to
 him.</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, aye, sir,&quot; responded the youth.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha! Quite seaman-like, if you don't mind a reference to
 it,&quot; commented Captain Weston with a smile. &quot;Mind your helm,
 boy, for you don't want to poke her nose into a mud bank, or
 run up on a shoal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Suppose you steer?&quot; suggested the lad. &quot;I'd rather take
 lessons for a while.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right. Perhaps it will be safer. I know these waters
 from the top, though I can't say as much for the bottom.
 However, I know where the shoals are.&quot;</p>

<p>The powerful searchlight was turned, so as to send its
 beams along the path which the submarine was to follow, and
 then, as she gathered speed, she shot ahead, gliding through
 the waters like a fish.</p>

<p>Mr. Damon divided his time between the forward pilot-room,
 the living-apartment, and the place where Mr. Swift, Garret
 Jackson and Mr. Sharp were working over the engines. Every
 few minutes he would bless some part of himself, his
 clothing, or the ship. Finally the old man settled down to
 look through the plate-glass windows in the main apartment.</p>

<p>On and on went the submarine. She behaved perfectly, and
 was under excellent control. Some times Tom, at the request
 of his father, would send her toward the surface by means of
 the deflecting rudder. Then she would dive to the bottom
 again. Once, as a test, she was sent obliquely to the
 surface, her tower just emerging, and then she darted
 downward again, like a porpoise that had come up to roll
 over, and suddenly concluded to seek the depths. In fact,
 had any one seen the maneuver they would have imagined the
 craft was a big fish disporting itself.</p>

<p>Captain Weston remained at Tom's side, giving him
 instructions, and watching the compass in order to direct
 the steering so as to avoid collisions. For an hour or more
 the craft was sent almost straight ahead at medium speed.
 Then Mr. Swift, joining his son and the captain, remarked:</p>

<p>&quot;How about depth of water here, Captain Weston?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You've got more than a mile.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good! Then I'm going down to the bottom of the sea! Tom,
 fill the tanks still more.</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, aye, sir,&quot; answered the lad gaily. &quot;Now for a new
 experience!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And use the deflecting rudder, also,&quot; advised his father.
 &quot;That will hasten matters.&quot;</p>

<p>Five minutes later there was a slight jar noticeable.</p>

<p>&quot;Bless my soul! What's that?&quot; cried Mr. Damon. &quot;Have we
 hit something?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Tom with a smile.</p>

<p>&quot;What, for gracious sake?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The bottom of the sea. We're on the bed of the ocean.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH12" id="CH12">Chapter Twelve</a></h2>

<h3>For a Breath of Air</h3>

<p>
 They could hardly realize it, yet the depth-gage told the
 story. It registered a distance below the surface of the
 ocean of five thousand seven hundred feet--a little over a
 mile. The Advance had actually come to rest on the bottom of
 the Atlantic.</p>

<p>&quot;Hurrah!&quot; cried Tom. &quot;Let's get on the diving suits, dad,
 and walk about on land under water for a change.&quot;</p>

<p>
 &quot;No,&quot; said Mr. Swift soberly. &quot;We will hardly have time
 for that now. Besides, the suits are not yet fitted with the
 automatic air-tanks, and we can't use them. There are still
 some things to do before we start on our treasure cruise.
 But I want to see how the plates are standing this
 pressure.&quot;</p>

<p>The Advance was made with a triple hull, the spaces
 between the layers of plates being filled with a secret
 material, capable of withstanding enormous pressure, as were
 also the plates themselves. Mr. Swift, aided by Mr. Jackson
 and Captain Weston, made a thorough examination, and found
 that not a drop of water had leaked in, nor was there the
 least sign that any of the plates had given way under the
 terrific strain.</p>

<p>&quot;She's as tight as a drum, if you will allow me to make
 that comparison,&quot; remarked Captain Weston modestly. &quot;I
 couldn't ask for a dryer ship.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, let's take a look around by means the searchlight
 and the observation windows, and then we'll go back,&quot;
 suggested Mr. Swift. &quot;It will take about two days to get the
 stores and provisions aboard and rig up the diving suits;
 then we will start for the sunken treasure.&quot;</p>

<p>There were several powerful searchlights on the Advance,
 so arranged that the bow, stern or either side could be
 illuminated independently. There were also observation
 windows near each light.</p>

<p>In turn the powerful rays were cast first at the bow and
 then aft. In the gleams could be seen the sandy bed of the
 ocean, covered with shells of various kinds. Great crabs
 walked around on their long, jointed legs, and Tom saw some
 lobsters that would have brought joy to the heart of a
 fisherman.</p>

<p>&quot;Look at the big fish!&quot; cried Mr. Damon suddenly, and he
 pointed to some dark, shadowy forms that swam up to the
 glass windows, evidently puzzled by the light.</p>

<p>&quot;Porpoises,&quot; declared Captain Weston briefly, &quot;a whole
 school of them.&quot;</p>

<p>The fish seemed suddenly to multiply, and soon those in
 the submarine felt curious tremors running through the whole
 craft.</p>

<p>&quot;The fish are rubbing up against it,&quot; cried Tom. &quot;They
 must think we came down here to allow them to scratch their
 backs on the steel plates.&quot;</p>

<p>For some time they remained on the bottom, watching the
 wonderful sight of the fishes that swam all about them.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I think we may as well rise,&quot; announced Mr. Swift,
 after they had been on the bottom about an hour, moving here
 and there. &quot;We didn't bring any provisions, and I'm getting
 hungry, though I don't know how the others of you feel about
 it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bless my dinner-plate, I could eat, too!&quot; cried Mr.
 Damon. &quot;Go up, by all means. We'll get enough of under-water
 travel once we start for the treasure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Send her up, Tom,&quot; called his father. &quot;I Want to make a
 few notes on some needed changes and improvements.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom entered the lower pilot house, and turned the valve
 that opened the tanks. He also pulled the lever that started
 the pumps, so that the water ballast would be more quickly
 emptied, as that would render the submarine buoyant, and she
 would quickly shoot to the surface. To the surprise of the
 lad, however, there followed no outrushing of the water. The
 Advance remained stationary on the ocean bed. Mr. Swift
 looked up from his notes.</p>

<p>&quot;Didn't you hear me ask you to send her up, Tom?&quot; he
 inquired mildly.</p>

<p>&quot;I did, dad, but something seems to be the matter,&quot; was
 the reply.</p>

<p>&quot;Matter? What do you mean?&quot; and the aged inventor hastened
 to where his son and Captain Weston were at the wheels,
 valves and levers.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, the tanks won't empty, and the pumps don't seem to
 work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let me try,&quot; suggested Mr. Swift, and he pulled the
 various handles. There was no corresponding action of the
 machinery.</p>

<p>&quot;That's odd,&quot; he remarked in a curious voice &quot;Perhaps
 something has gone wrong with the connections. Go look in
 the engine-room, and ask Mr. Sharp if everything is all
 right there.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom made a quick trip, returning to report that the
 dynamos, motors and gas engine were running perfectly.</p>

<p>&quot;Try to work the tank levers and pumps from the conning
 tower,&quot; suggested Captain Weston. &quot;Sometimes I've known the
 steam steering gear to play tricks like that.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom hurried up the circular stairway into the tower. He
 pulled the levers and shifted the valves and wheels there.
 But there was no emptying of the water tanks. The weight and
 pressure of water in them still held the submarine on the
 bottom of the sea, more than a mile from the surface. The
 pumps in the engine-room were working at top speed, but
 there was evidently something wrong in the connections.
 Mr. Swift quickly came to this conclusion.</p>

<p>&quot;We must repair it at once,&quot; he said. &quot;Tom, come to the
 engine-room. You and I, with Mr. Jackson and Mr. Sharp, will
 soon have it in shape again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is there any danger?&quot; asked Mr. Damon in a perturbed
 voice. &quot;Bless my soul, it's unlucky to have an accident on
 our trial trip.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, we must expect accidents,&quot; declared Mr. Swift with a
 smile. &quot;This is nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>But it proved to be more difficult than he had imagined
 to re-establish the connection between the pumps and the
 tanks. The valves, too, had clogged or jammed, and as the
 pressure outside the ship was so great, the water would not
 run out of itself. It must be forced.</p>

<p>For an hour or more the inventor, his son and the others,
 worked away. They could accomplish nothing. Tom looked
 anxiously at his parent when the latter paused in his
 efforts.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't worry,&quot; advised the aged inventor. &quot;It's got to
 come right sooner or later.&quot;</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Damon, who had been wandering about the
 ship, entered the engine-room.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know,&quot; he said, &quot;you ought to open a window, or
 something.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, what's the matter?&quot; asked Tom quickly, looking to
 see if the odd man was joking.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, of course I don't exactly mean a window,&quot; explained
 Mr. Damon, &quot;but we need fresh air.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fresh air!&quot; There was a startled note in Mr. Swift's
 voice as he repeated the words.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I can hardly breathe in the living-room, and it's
 not much better here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, there ought to be plenty of fresh air,&quot; went on the
 inventor. &quot;It is renewed automatically.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom jumped up and looked at an indicator. He uttered a
 startled cry.</p>

<p>&quot;The air hasn't been changed in the last hour!&quot; he
 exclaimed. &quot;It is bad. There's not enough oxygen in it. I
 notice it, now that I've stopped working. The gage indicates
 it, too. The automatic air-changer must have stopped
 working. I'll fix it.&quot;</p>

<p>He hurried to the machine which was depended on to supply
 fresh air to the submarine.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, the air tanks are empty!&quot; the young inventor cried.
 &quot;We haven't any more air except what is in the ship now!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And we're rapidly breathing that up,&quot; added Captain
 Weston solemnly.</p>

<p>&quot;Can't you make more?&quot; cried Mr. Damon. &quot;I thought you
 said you could make oxygen aboard the ship.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We can,&quot; answered Mr. Swift, &quot;but I did not bring along a
 supply of the necessary chemicals. I did not think we would
 be submerged long enough for that. But there should have
 been enough in the reserve tank to last several days. How
 about it, Tom?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's all leaked out, or else it wasn't filled,&quot; was the
 despairing answer. &quot;All the air we have is what's in the
 ship, and we can't make more.&quot;</p>

<p>The treasure-seekers looked at each other. It was an awful
 situation.</p>

<p>&quot;Then the only thing to do is to fix the machinery and
 rise to the surface,&quot; said Mr. Sharp simply. &quot;We can have
 all the air we want, then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but the machinery doesn't seem possible of being
 fixed,&quot; spoke Tom in a low voice.</p>

<p>&quot;We must do it!&quot; cried his father.</p>

<p>They set to work again with fierce energy, laboring for
 their very lives. They all knew that they could not long
 remain in the ship without oxygen. Nor could they desert it
 to go to the surface, for the moment they left the
 protection of the thick steel sides the terrible pressure of
 the water would kill them. Nor were the diving suits
 available. They must stay in the craft and die a miserable
 death-unless the machinery could be repaired and the Advance
 sent to the surface. The emergency expanding lifting tank
 was not yet in working order.</p>

<p>More frantically they toiled, trying every device that was
suggested to the mechanical minds of Tom, his father, Mr.
Sharp or Mr. Jackson, to make the pumps work. But something
was wrong. More and more foul grew the air. They were
fairly gasping now. It was difficult to breathe, to say
nothing of working, in that atmosphere. The thought of their
terrible position was in the minds of all.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, for one breath of fresh air!&quot; cried Mr. Damon, who
 seemed to suffer more than any of the others. Grim death was
 hovering around them, imprisoned as they were on the ocean's
 bed, over a mile from the surface.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH13" id="CH13">Chapter Thirteen</a></h2>

<h3>Off for the Treasure</h3>

<p> Suddenly Tom, after a moment's pause, seized a wrench and
 began loosening some nuts.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing?&quot; asked his father faintly, for he was
 being weakened by the vitiated atmosphere.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm going to take this valve apart,&quot; replied his son. &quot;We
 haven't looked there for the trouble. Maybe it's out of
 order.&quot;</p>

<p>
 He attacked the valve with energy, but his hands soon
 lagged. The lack of oxygen was telling on him. He could no
 longer work quickly.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll help,&quot; murmured Mr. Sharp thickly. He took a wrench,
 but no sooner had he loosened one nut than he toppled over.
 &quot;I'm all in,&quot; he murmured feebly.</p>

<p>&quot;Is he dead?&quot; cried Mr. Damon, himself gasping.</p>

<p>&quot;No, only fainted. But he soon will be dead, and so will
 all of us, if we don't get fresh air,&quot; remarked Captain
 Weston. &quot;Lie down on the floor, every one. There is a little
 fairly good air there. It's heavier than the air we've
 breathed, and we can exist on it for a little longer. Poor
 Sharp was so used to breathing the rarified air of high
 altitudes that he can't stand this heavy atmosphere.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Damon was gasping worse than ever, and so was Mr.
 Swift. The balloonist lay an inert heap on the floor, with
 Captain Weston trying to force a few drops of stimulant down
 his throat.</p>

<p>With a fierce determination in his heart, but with fingers
 that almost refused to do his bidding, Tom once more sought
 to open the big valve. He felt sure the trouble was located
 there, as they had tried to locate it in every other place
 without avail.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll help,&quot; said Mr. Jackson in a whisper. He, too, was
 hardly able to move.</p>

<p>More and more devoid of oxygen grew the air. It gave Tom a
 sense as if his head was filled, and ready to burst with
 every breath he drew. Still he struggled to loosen the nuts.
 There were but four more now, and he took off three while
 Mr. Jackson removed one. The young inventor lifted off the
 valve cover, though it felt like a ton weight to him. He
 gave a glance inside.</p>

<p>&quot;Here's the trouble!&quot; he murmured. &quot;The valve's clogged.
 No wonder it wouldn't work. The pumps couldn't force the
 water out.&quot;</p>

<p>It was the work of only a minute to adjust the valve. Then
 Tom and the engineer managed to get the cover back on.</p>

<p>How they inserted the bolts and screwed the nuts in place
 they never could remember clearly afterward, but they
 managed it somehow, with shaking, trembling hands and eyes
 that grew more and more dim.</p>

<p>&quot;Now start the pumps!&quot; cried Tom faintly. &quot;The tanks will
 be emptied, and we can get to the surface.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Sharp was still unconscious, nor was Mr. Swift able to
 help. He lay with his eyes closed. Garret Jackson, however,
 managed to crawl to the engine-room, and soon the clank of
 machinery told Tom that the pumps were in motion. The lad
 staggered to the pilot house and threw the levers over. An
 instant later there was the hissing of water as it rushed
 from the ballast tanks. The submarine shivered, as though
 disliking to leave the bottom of the sea, and then slowly
 rose. As the pumps worked more rapidly, and the sea was sent
 from the tank in great volumes, the boat fairly shot to the
 surface. Tom was ready to open the conning tower and let in
 fresh air as soon as the top was above the surface.</p>

<p>With a bound the Advance reached the top. Tom frantically
 worked the worm gear that opened the tower. In rushed the
 fresh, life-giving air, and the treasure-hunters filled
 their lungs with it.</p>

<p>And it was only just in time, for Mr. Sharp was almost
 gone. He quickly revived, as did the others, when they could
 breathe as much as they wished of the glorious oxygen.</p>

<p>&quot;That was a close call,&quot; commented Mr. Swift. &quot;We'll not
 go below again until I have provided for all emergencies. I
 should have seen to the air tanks and the expanding one
 before going below. We'll sail home on the surface now.&quot;</p>

<p>The submarine was put about and headed for her dock. On
 the way she passed a small steamer, and the passengers
 looked down in wonder at the strange craft.</p>

<p>When the Advance reached the secluded creek where she had
 been launched, her passengers had fully recovered from their
 terrible experience, though the nerves of Mr. Swift and Mr.
 Damon were not at ease for some days thereafter.</p>

<p>&quot;I should never have made a submerged test without making
 sure that we had a reserve supply of air,&quot; remarked the aged
 inventor. &quot;I will not be caught that way again. But I can't
 understand how the pump valve got out of order.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe some one tampered with it,&quot; suggested Mr. Damon.
 &quot;Could Andy Foger, any of the Happy Harry gang, or the rival
 gold-seekers have done it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hardly think so,&quot; answered Tom. &quot;The place has been too
 carefully guarded since Berg and Andy once sneaked in. I
 think it was just an accident, but I have thought of a plan
 whereby such accidents can be avoided in the future. It
 needs a simple device.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Better patent it,&quot; suggested Mr. Sharp with a smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe I will,&quot; replied the young inventor. &quot;But not now.
 We haven't time, if we intend to get fitted out for our
 trip.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; I should say the sooner we started the better,&quot;
 remarked Captain Weston. &quot;That is, if you don't mind me
 speaking about it,&quot; he added gently, and the others smiled,
 for his diffident comments were only a matter of habit.</p>

<p>The first act of the adventurers, after tying the
 submarine at the dock, was to proceed with the loading of
 the food and supplies. Tom and Mr. Damon looked to this,
 while Mr. Swift and Mr. Sharp made some necessary changes to
 the machinery. The next day the young inventor attached his
 device to the pump valve, and the loading of the craft was
 continued.</p>

<p>All was in readiness for the gold-seeking expedition a
 week later. Captain Weston had carefully charted the route
 they were to follow, and it was decided to move along on the
 surface for the first day, so as to get well out to sea
 before submerging the craft. Then it would sink below the
 surface, and run along under the water until the wreck was
 reached, rising at times, as needed, to renew the air
 supply.</p>

<p>With sufficient stores and provisions aboard to last
 several months, if necessary, though they did not expect to
 be gone more than sixty days at most, the adventurers arose
 early one morning and went down to the dock. Mr. Jackson was
 not to accompany them. He did not care about a submarine
 trip, he said, and Mr. Swift desired him to remain at the
 seaside cottage and guard the shops, which contained much
 valuable machinery. The airship was also left there.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, are we all ready?&quot; asked Mr. Swift of the little
 party of gold-seekers, as they were about to enter the
 conning tower hatchway of the submarine.</p>

<p>&quot;All ready, dad,&quot; responded his son.</p>

<p>&quot;Then let's get aboard,&quot; proposed Captain Weston. &quot;But
 first let me take an observation.&quot;</p>

<p>He swept the horizon with his telescope, and Tom noticed
 that the sailor kept it fixed on one particular spot for
 some time.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you see anything?&quot; asked the lad.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, there is a boat lying off there,&quot; was the answer.
 &quot;And some one is observing us through a glass. But I don't
 believe it matters. Probably they're only trying to see what
 sort of an odd fish we are.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All aboard, then,&quot; ordered Mr. Swift, and they went into
 the submarine. Tom and his father, with Captain Weston,
 remained in the conning tower. The signal was given, the
 electricity flowed into the forward and aft plates, and the
 Advance shot ahead on the surface.</p>

<p>The sailor raised his telescope once more and peered
 through a window in the tower. He uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter?&quot; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;That other ship--a small steamer--is weighing anchor and
 seems to be heading this way,&quot; was the reply.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe it's some one hired by Berg to follow us and trace
 our movements,&quot; suggested Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;If it is we'll fool them,&quot; added his father. &quot;Just keep
 an eye on them, captain, and I think we can show them a
 trick or two in a few minutes.&quot;</p>

<p>Faster shot the Advance through the water. She had started
 on her way to get the gold from the sunken wreck, but
 already enemies were on the trail of the adventurers, for
 the ship the sailor had noticed was steaming after them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH14" id="CH14">Chapter Fourteen</a></h2>

<h3>In the Diving Suits</h3>

<p>
 There was no doubt that the steamer was coming after the
 submarine. Several observations Captain Weston made
 confirmed this, and he reported the fact to Mr. Swift.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we'll change our plans, then,&quot; said the inventor.
 &quot;Instead of sailing on the surface we'll go below. But first
 let them get near so they may have the benefit of seeing
 what we do. Tom, go below, please, and tell Mr. Sharp to get
 every thing in readiness for a quick descent. We'll slow up
 a bit now, and let them get nearer to us.&quot;</p>

<p>
 The speed of the submarine was reduced, and in a short
 time the strange steamer had overhauled her, coming to
 within hailing distance.</p>

<p>Mr. Swift signaled for the machinery to stop and the
 submarine came to a halt on the surface, bobbing about like
 a half-submerged bottle. The inventor opened a bull's-eye in
 the tower, and called to a man on the bridge of the steamer:</p>

<p>&quot;What are you following us for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Following you?&quot; repeated the man, for the strange vessel
 had also come to a stop. &quot;We're not following you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It looks like it,&quot; replied Mr. Swift. &quot;You'd better give
 it up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I guess the waters are free,&quot; was the quick retort.
 &quot;We'll follow you if we like.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will you? Then come on!&quot; cried the inventor as he quickly
 closed the heavy glass window and pulled a lever. An instant
 later the submarine began to sink, and Mr. Swift could not
 help laughing as, just before the tower went under water, he
 had a glimpse of the astonished face of the man on the
 bridge. The latter had evidently not expected such a move as
 that.</p>

<p>Lower and lower in the water went the craft, until it was
 about two hundred feet below the surface. Then Mr. Swift
 left the conning tower, descended to the main part of the
 ship, and asked Tom and Captain Weston to take charge of the
 pilot house.</p>

<p>&quot;Send her ahead, Tom,&quot; his father said. &quot;That fellow up
 above is rubbing his eyes yet, wondering where we are, I
 suppose.&quot;</p>

<p>Forward shot the Advance under water, the powerful
 electrical plates pulling and pushing her on the way to
 secure the sunken gold.</p>

<p>All that morning a fairly moderate rate of speed was
 maintained, as it was thought best not to run the new
 machinery too fast.</p>

<p>Dinner was eaten about a quarter of a mile below the
 surface, but no one inside the submarine would ever have
 known it. Electric lights made the place as brilliant as
 could be desired, and the food, which Tom and Mr. Damon
 prepared, was equal to any that could have been served on
 land. After the meal they opened the shutters over the
 windows in the sides of the craft, and looked at the myriads
 of fishes swimming past, as the creatures were disclosed in
 the glare of the searchlight.</p>

<p>That night they were several hundred miles on their
 journey, for the craft was speedy, and leaving Tom and
 Captain Weston to take the first watch, the others went to
 bed.</p>

<p>&quot;Bless my soul, but it does seem odd, though, to go to bed
 under water, like a fish,&quot; remarked Mr. Damon. &quot;If my wife
 knew this she would worry to death. She thinks I'm off
 automobiling. But this isn't half as dangerous as riding in
 a car that's always getting out of order. A submarine for
 mine, every time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait until we get to the end of this trip,&quot; advised Tom.
 &quot;I guess you'll find almost as many things can happen in a
 submarine as can in an auto,&quot; and future events were to
 prove the young inventor to be right.</p>

<p>Everything worked well that night, and the ship made good
 progress. They rose to the surface the next morning to make
 sure of their position, and to get fresh air, though they
 did not really need the latter, as the reserve supply had
 not been drawn on, and was sufficient for several days, now
 that the oxygen machine had been put in running order.</p>

<p>On the second day the ship was sent to the bottom and
 halted there, as Mr. Swift wished to try the new diving
 suits. These were made of a new, light, but very strong
 metal to withstand the pressure of a great depth.</p>

<p>Tom, Mr. Sharp and Captain Weston donned the suits, the
 others agreeing to wait until they saw how the first trial
 resulted. Then, too, it was necessary for some one
 acquainted with the machinery to remain in the ship to
 operate the door and water chamber through which the divers
 had to pass to get out.</p>

<p>The usual plan, with some changes, was followed in letting
 the three out of the boat, and on to the bottom of the sea.
 They entered a chamber in the side of the submarine, water
 was gradually admitted until it equaled in pressure that
 outside, then an outer door was opened by means of levers,
 and they could step out</p>

<p>It was a curious sensation to Tom and the others to feel
 that they were actually walking along the bed of the ocean.
 All around them was the water, and as they turned on the
 small electric lights in their helmets, which lights were
 fed by storage batteries fastened to the diving suits, they
 saw the fish, big and little, swarm up to them, doubtless
 astonished at the odd creatures which had entered their
 domain. On the sand of the bottom, and in and out among the
 shells and rocks, crawled great spider crabs, big eels and
 other odd creatures seldom seen on the surface of the water.
 The three divers found no difficulty in breathing, as there
 were air tanks fastened to their shoulders, and a constant
 supply of oxygen was fed through pipes into the helmets. The
 pressure of water did not bother them, and after the first
 sensation Tom began to enjoy the novelty of it. At first the
 inability to speak to his companions seemed odd, but he
 soon got so he could make signs and motions, and be
 understood.</p>

<p>They walked about for some time, and once the lad came
 upon a part of a wrecked vessel buried deep in the sand.
 There was no telling what ship it was, nor how long it had
 been there, and after silently viewing it, they continued on</p>

<p>&quot;It was great!&quot; were the first words Tom uttered when he
 and the others were once more inside the submarine and had
 removed the suits. &quot;If we can only walk around the wreck of
 the Boldero that way, we'll have all the gold out of her in
 no time. There are no life-lines nor air-hose to bother with
 in these diving suits.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They certainly are a success,&quot; conceded Mr. Sharp.</p>

<p>&quot;Bless my topknot!&quot; cried Mr. Damon. &quot;I'll try it next
 time. I've always wanted to be a diver, and now I have the
 chance.&quot;</p>

<p>The trip was resumed after the diving chamber had been
 closed, and on the third day Captain Weston announced, after
 a look at his chart, that they were nearing the Bahama
 Islands.</p>

<p>&quot;We'll have to be careful not to run into any of the small
 keys,&quot; he said, that being the name for the many little
 points of land, hardly large enough to be dignified by the
 name of island. &quot;We must keep a constant lookout.&quot;</p>

<p>Fortune favored them, though once, when Tom was steering,
 he narrowly avoided ramming a coral reef with the submarine.
 The searchlight showed it to him just in time, and he
 sheered off with a thumping in his heart.</p>

<p>The course was changed from south to east, so as to get
 ready to swing out of the way of the big shoulder of South
 America where Brazil takes up so much room, and as they went
 farther and farther toward the equator, they noticed that
 the waters teemed more and more with fish, some beautiful,
 some ugly and fear-inspiring, and some such monsters that it
 made one shudder to look at them, even through the thick
 glass of the bulls-eye windows.</p>

<h3>At the Tropical Island</h3>

<p>
 It was on the evening of the fourth day later that Captain
 Weston, who was steering the craft, suddenly called out:</p>

<p>&quot;Land ho!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where away?&quot; inquired Tom quickly, for he had read that
 this was the proper response to make.</p>

<p>&quot;Dead ahead,&quot; answered the sailor with a smile. &quot;Shall we
 make for it, if I may be allowed the question?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What land is it likely to be?&quot; Mr. Swift wanted to know.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, some small tropical island,&quot; replied the seafaring
 man. &quot;It isn't down on the charts. Probably it's too small
 to note. I should say it was a coral island, but we may be
 able to find a Spring of fresh water there, and some fruit.&quot;</p>

<p>
 &quot;Then we'll land there,&quot; decided the inventor. &quot;We can use
 some fresh water, though our distilling and ice apparatus
 does very well.&quot;</p>

<p>They made the island just at dusk, and anchored in a
 little lagoon, where there was a good depth of water.</p>

<p>&quot;Now for shore!&quot; cried Tom, as the submarine swung around
 on the chain. &quot;It looks like a fine place. I hope there are
 cocoanuts and oranges here. Shall I get out the electric
 launch, dad?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, you may, and we'll all go ashore. It will do us good
 to stretch our legs a bit.&quot;</p>

<p>Carried in a sort of pocket on the deck of the submarine
 was a small electric boat, capable of holding six. It could
 be slid from the pocket, or depression, into the water
 without the use of davits, and, with Mr. Sharp to aid him,
 Tom soon had the little craft afloat. The batteries were
 already charged, and just as the sun was going down the
 gold-seekers entered the launch and were soon on shore.</p>

<p>They found a good spring of water close at hand, and Tom's
 wish regarding the cocoanuts was realized, though there were
 no oranges. The lad took several of the delicious nuts, and
 breaking them open poured the milk into a collapsible cup he
 carried, drinking it eagerly. The others followed his
 example, and pronounced it the best beverage they had tasted
 in a long time.</p>

<p>The island was a typical tropical one, not very large, and
 it did not appear to have been often visited by man. There
 were no animals to be seen, but myriads of birds flew here
 and there amid the trees, the trailing vines and streamers
 of moss.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's spend a day here to-morrow and explore it,&quot;
 proposed Tom, and his father nodded an assent. They went
 back to the submarine as night was beginning to gather, and
 in the cabin, after supper, talked over the happenings of
 their trip so far.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think we'll have any trouble getting
 the gold out of the wrecked vessel?&quot; asked Tom of Captain
 Weston, after a pause.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's hard to say. I couldn't learn just how the
 wreck lays, whether it's on a sandy or a rocky bottom. If
 the latter, it won't be so hard, but if the sand has worked
 in and partly covered it, we'll have some difficulties, if I
 may be permitted to say so. However, don't borrow trouble.
 We're not there yet, though at the rate we're traveling it
 won't be long before we arrive.&quot;</p>

<p>No watch was set that night, as it was not considered
 necessary. Tom was the first to arise in the morning, and he
 went out on the deck for a breath of fresh air before
 breakfast.</p>

<p>He looked off at the beautiful little island, and as his
 eye took in all of the little lagoon where the submarine was
 anchored he uttered a startled cry.</p>

<p>And well he might, for, not a hundred yards away, and
 nearer to the island than was the Advance, floated another
 craft--another craft, almost similar in shape and size to
 the one built by the Swifts. Tom rubbed his eyes to make
 sure he was not seeing double. No, there could be no mistake
 about it. There was another submarine at the tropical
 island.</p>

<p>As he looked, some one emerged from the conning tower of
 the second craft. The figure seemed strangely familiar. Tom
 knew in a moment who it was--Addison Berg. The agent saw the
 lad, too, and taking off his cap and making a mocking bow,
 he called out:</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning! Have you got the gold yet?&quot;</p>

<p>Tom did not know what to answer. Seeing the other
 submarine, at an island where he had supposed they would not
 be disturbed, was disconcerting enough, but to be greeted by
 Berg was altogether too much, Tom thought. His fears that
 the rival boat builders would follow had not been without
 foundation.</p>

<p>&quot;Rather surprised to see us, aren't you?&quot; went on Mr.
 Berg, smiling.</p>

<p>&quot;Rather,&quot; admitted Tom, choking over the word.</p>

<p>&quot;Thought you'd be,&quot; continued Berg. &quot;We didn't expect to
 meet you so soon, but we're glad we did. I don't altogether
 like hunting for sunken treasure, with such indefinite
 directions as I have.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You--are going to--&quot; stammered Tom, and then he concluded
 it would be best not to say anything. But his talk had been
 heard inside the submarine. His father came to the foot of
 the conning tower stairway.</p>

<p>&quot;To whom are you speaking, Tom?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;They're here, dad,&quot; was the youth's answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Here? Who are here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Berg and his employers. They've followed us, dad.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH16" id="CH16">Chapter Sixteen</a></h2>

<h3>&quot;We'll Race You For It&quot;</h3>

<p> Mr. Swift hurried up on deck. He was accompanied by
 Captain Weston. At the sight of Tom's father, Mr. Berg, who
 had been joined by' two other men, called out:</p>

<p>&quot;You see we also concluded to give up the trial for the
 Government prize, Mr. Swift. We decided there was more money
 in something else. But we still will have a good chance to
 try the merits of our respective boats. We hurried and got
 ours fitted up almost as soon as you did yours, and I think
 we have the better craft.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't care to enter into any competition with you,&quot;
 said Mr. Swift coldly.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, but I'm afraid you'll have to, whether you want to or
 not,&quot; was the insolent reply.</p>

<p>
 &quot;What's that? Do you mean to force this matter upon me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid I'll have to--my employers and I, that is. You
 see, we managed to pick up your trail after you left the
 Jersey coast, having an idea where you were bound, and we
 don't intend to lose you now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you mean to follow us?&quot; asked Captain Weston softly.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you can put it that way if you like,&quot; answered one
 of the two men with Mr. Berg.</p>

<p>&quot;I forbid it!&quot; cried Mr. Swift hotly. &quot;You have no right
 to sneak after us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I guess the ocean is free,&quot; continued the rascally agent.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you persist in keeping after us?&quot; inquired the
 aged inventor, thinking it well to ascertain, if possible,
 just how much the men knew.</p>

<p>&quot;Because we're after that treasure as well as you,&quot; was
 the bold reply. &quot;You have no exclusive right to it. The
 sunken ship is awaiting the first comer, and whoever gets
 there first can take the gold from the wreck. We intend to
 be there first, but we'll be fair with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fair? What do you mean?&quot; demanded Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;This: We'll race you for it. The first one to arrive will
 have the right to search the wreck for the gold bullion. Is
 that fair? Do you agree to it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We agree to nothing with you,&quot; interrupted Captain
 Weston, his usual diffident manner all gone. &quot;I happen to be
 in partial command of this craft, and I warn you that if I
 find you interfering with us it won't be healthy for you.
 I'm not fond of fighting, but when I begin I don't like to
 stop,&quot; and he smiled grimly. &quot;You'd better not follow us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We'll do as we please,&quot; shouted the third member of the
 trio on the deck of the other boat, which, as Tom could see,
 was named the Wonder. &quot;We intend to get that gold if we
 can,&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right. I've warned you,&quot; went on the sailor, and
 then, motioning to Tom and his father to follow, he went
 below.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what's to be done?&quot; asked Mr. Swift when they were
 seated in the living-room, and had informed the others of
 the presence of the rival submarine.</p>

<p>&quot;The only thing I see to do is to sneak away unobserved,
 go as deep as possible, and make all haste for the wreck,&quot;
 advised the captain. &quot;They will depend on us, for they have
 evidently no chart of the wreck, though of course the
 general location of it may be known to them from reading the
 papers. I hoped I had thrown them off the track by the false
 chart I dropped, but it seems they were too smart for us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have they a right to follow us?&quot; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;Legally, but not morally. We can't prevent them, I'm
 afraid. The only thing to do is to get there ahead of them.
 It will be a race for the sunken treasure, and we must get
 there first.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you propose doing, captain?&quot; asked Mr. Damon.
 &quot;Bless my shirt-studs, but can't we pull their ship up on
 the island and leave it there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid such high-handed proceedings would hardly
 answer,&quot; replied Mr. Swift. &quot;No, as Captain Weston says, we
 must get there ahead of them. What do you think will be the
 best scheme, captain?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, there's no need for us to forego our plan to get
 fresh water. Suppose we go to the island, that is, some of
 us, leaving a guard on board here. We'll fill our tanks with
 fresh water, and at night we'll quietly sink below the
 surface and speed away.&quot;</p>

<p>They all voted that an excellent idea, and little time was
 lost putting it into operation.</p>

<p>All the remainder of that day not a sign of life was
 visible about the Wonder. She lay inert on the surface of
 the lagoon, not far away from the Advance; but, though no
 one showed himself on the deck, Tom and his friends had no
 doubt but that their enemies were closely watching them.</p>

<p>As dusk settled down over The tropical sea, and as the
 shadows of the trees on the little island lengthened, those
 on board the Advance closed the Conning tower. No lights
 were turned on, as they did not want their movements to be
 seen, but Tom, his father and Mr. Sharp took their positions
 near the various machines and apparatus, ready to open the
 tanks and let the submarine sink to the bottom, as soon as
 it was possible to do this unobserved.</p>

<p>&quot;Luckily there's no moon,&quot; remarked Captain Weston, as he
 took his place beside Tom. &quot;Once below the surface and we
 can defy them to find us. It is odd how they traced us, but
 I suppose that steamer gave them the clue.&quot;</p>

<p>It rapidly grew dark, as it always does in the tropics,
 and when a cautious observation from the conning tower did
 not disclose the outlines of the other boat, those aboard
 the Advance rightly concluded that their rivals were unable
 to see them.</p>

<p>&quot;Send her down, Tom,&quot; called his father, and with a hiss
 the water entered the tanks. The submarine quickly sank
 below the surface, aided by the deflecting rudder.</p>

<p>But alas for the hopes of the gold-seekers. No sooner was
 she completely submerged, with the engine started so as to
 send her out of the lagoon and to the open sea, than the
 waters all about were made brilliant by the phosphorescent
 phenomenon. In southern waters this frequently occurs.
 Millions of tiny creatures, which, it is said, swarm in the
 warm currents, give an appearance of fire to the ocean, and
 any object moving through it can plainly be seen. It was so
 with the Advance. The motion she made in shooting forward,
 and the undulations caused by her submersion, seemed to
 start into activity the dormant phosphorus, and the
 submarine was afloat in a sea of fire.</p>

<p>&quot;Quick!&quot; cried Tom. &quot;Speed her up! Maybe we can get out of
 this patch of water before they see us.&quot;</p>

<p>But it was too late. Above them they could hear the
 electric siren of the Wonder as it was blown to let them
 know that their escape had been noticed. A moment later the
 water, which acted as a sort of sounding-board, or
 telephone, brought to the ears of Tom Swift and his friends
 the noise of the engines of the other craft in operation.
 She was coming after them. The race for the possession of
 three hundred thousand dollars in gold was already under
 way. Fate seemed against those on board the Advance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH17" id="CH17">Chapter Seventeen</a></h2>

<h3>The Race</h3>

<p> Directed by Captain Weston, who glanced at the compass and
 told him which way to steer to clear the outer coral reef,
 Tom sent the submarine ahead, signaling for full speed to
 the engine-room, where his father and Mr. Sharp were. The
 big dynamos purred like great cats, as they sent the
 electrical energy into the forward and aft plates, pulling
 and pushing the Advance forward. On and on she rushed under
 water, but ever as she shot ahead the disturbance in the
 phosphorescent water showed her position plainly. She would
 be easy to follow.</p>

<p>
 &quot;Can't you get any more speed out of her?&quot; asked the
 captain of the lad.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; was the quick reply; &quot;by using the auxiliary screws
 I think we can. I'll try it.&quot;</p>

<p>He signaled for the propellers, forward and aft, to be put
 in operation, and the motor moving the twin screws was
 turned on. At once there was a perceptible increase to the
 speed of the Advance.</p>

<p>&quot;Are we leaving them behind?&quot; asked Tom anxiously, as he
 glanced at the speed gage, and noted that the submarine was
 now about five hundred feet below the surface.</p>

<p>&quot;Hard to tell,&quot; replied the Captain. &quot;You'd have to take
 an observation to make sure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll do it,&quot; cried the youth. &quot;You steer, please, and
 I'll go in the conning tower. I can look forward and aft
 there, as well as straight up. Maybe I can see the Wonder.&quot;</p>

<p>Springing up the circular ladder leading into the tower,
 Tom glanced through the windows all about the small pilot
 house. He saw a curious sight. It was as if the submarine
 was in a sea of yellowish liquid fire. She was immersed in
 water which glowed with the flames that contained no heat.
 So light was it, in fact, that there was no need of the
 incandescents in the tower. The young inventor could have
 seen to read a paper by the illumination of the phosphorus.
 But he had something else to do than observe this
 phenomenon. He wanted to see if he could catch sight of the
 rival submarine.</p>

<p>At first he could make out nothing save the swirl and
 boiling of the sea, caused by the progress of the Advance
 through it. But suddenly, as he looked up, he was aware of
 some great, black body a little to the rear and about ten
 feet above his craft.</p>

<p>&quot;A shark!&quot; he exclaimed aloud. &quot;An immense one, too.&quot;</p>

<p>But the closer he looked the less it seemed like a shark.
 The position of the black object changed. It appeared to
 settle down, to be approaching the top of the conning tower.
 Then, with a suddenness that unnerved him for the time
 being, Tom recognized what it was; it was the underside of a
 ship. He could see the plates riveted together, and then, as
 be noted the rounded, cylindrical shape, he knew that it was
 a submarine. It was the Wonder. She was close at hand and
 was creeping up on the Advance. But, what was more
 dangerous, she seemed to be slowly settling in the water.
 Another moment and her great screws might crash into the
 Conning tower of the Swifts' boat and shave it off. Then the
 water would rush in, drowning the treasure-seekers like rats
 in a trap.</p>

<p>With a quick motion Tom yanked over the lever that allowed
 more water to flow into the ballast tanks. The effect was at
 once apparent. The Advance shot down toward the bottom of
 the sea. At the same time the young inventor signaled to
 Captain Weston to notify those in the engine-room to put on
 a little more speed. The Advance fairly leaped ahead, and
 the lad, looking up through the bull's-eye in the roof of
 the conning tower, had the satisfaction of seeing the rival
 submarine left behind.</p>

<p>The youth hurried down into the interior of the ship to
 tell what he had seen, and explain the reason for opening
 the ballast tanks. He found his father and Mr. Sharp
 somewhat excited over the unexpected maneuver of the craft.</p>

<p>&quot;So they're still following us,&quot; murmured Mr. Swift. &quot;I
 don't see why we can't shake them off.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's on account of this luminous water,&quot; explained
 Captain Weston. &quot;Once we are clear of that it will be easy,
 I think, to give them the slip. That is, if we can get out
 of their sight long enough. Of course, if they keep close
 after us, they can pick us up with their searchlight, for I
 suppose they carry one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; admitted the aged inventor, &quot;they have as strong a
 one as we have. In fact, their ship is second only to this
 one in speed and power. I know, for Bentley &amp; Eagert
showed
 me some of the plans before they started it, and asked my
 opinion. This was before I had the notion of building a
 submarine. Yes, I am afraid we'll have trouble getting away
 from them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't understand this phosphorescent glow keeping up so
 long,&quot; remarked Captain Weston. &quot;I've seen it in this
 locality several times, but it never covered such an extent
 of the ocean in my time. There must be changed conditions
 here now.&quot;</p>

<p>For an hour or more the race was kept up, and the two
 submarines forged ahead through the glowing sea. The Wonder
 remained slightly above and to the rear of the other, the
 better to keep sight of her, and though the Advance was run
 to her limit of speed, her rival could not be shaken off.
 Clearly the Wonder was a speedy craft.</p>

<p>&quot;It's too bad that we've got to fight them, as well as run
 the risk of lots of other troubles which are always present
 when sailing under water,&quot; observed Mr Damon, who wandered
 about the submarine like the nervous person he was. &quot;Bless
 my shirt-studs! Can't we blow them up, or cripple them in
 some way? They have no right to go after our treasure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I guess they've got as much right as we have,&quot;
 declared Tom. &quot;It goes to whoever reaches the wreck first.
 But what I don't like is their mean, sneaking way of doing
 it. If they went off on their own hook and looked for it I
 wouldn't say a word. But they expect us to lead them to the
 wreck, and then they'll rob us if they can. That's not
 fair.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed, it isn't,&quot; agreed Captain Weston, &quot;if I may be
 allowed the expression. We ought to find some way of
 stopping them. But, if I'm not mistaken,&quot; he added quickly,
 looking from one of the port bull's-eyes, &quot;the
 phosphorescent glow is lessening. I believe we are running
 beyond that part of the ocean.&quot;</p>

<p>There was no doubt of it, the glow was growing less and
 less, and ten minutes later the Advance was speeding along
 through a sea as black as night. Then, to avoid running into
 some wreck, it was necessary to turn on the searchlight.</p>

<p>&quot;Are they still after us?&quot; asked Mr. Swift of his son, as
 he emerged from the engine-room, where he had gone to make
 some adjustments to the machinery, with the hope of
 increasing the speed.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll go look,&quot; volunteered the lad. He climbed up into
 the conning tower again, and for a moment, as he gazed back
 into the black waters swirling all about, he hoped that they
 had lost the Wonder. But a moment later his heart sank as he
 caught sight, through the liquid element, of the flickering
 gleams of another searchlight, the rays undulating through
 the sea.</p>

<p>&quot;Still following,&quot; murmured the young inventor. &quot;They're
 not going to give up. But we must make 'em--that's all.&quot;</p>

<p>He went down to report what he had seen, and a
 consultation was held. Captain Weston carefully studied the
 charts of that part of the ocean, and finding that there was
 a great depth of water at hand, proposed a series of
 evolutions.</p>

<p>&quot;We can go up and down, shoot first to one side and then
 to the other,&quot; he explained. &quot;We can even drop down to the
 bottom and rest there for a while. Perhaps, in that way, we
 can shake them off.&quot;</p>

<p>They tried it. The Advance was sent up until her conning
 tower was out of the water, and then she was suddenly forced
 down until she was but a few feet from the bottom. She
 darted to the left, to the right, and even doubled and went
 back over the course she had taken. But all to no purpose.
 The Wonder proved fully as speedy, and those in her seemed
 to know just how to handle the submarine, so that every
 evolution of the Advance was duplicated. Her rival could not
 be shaken off.</p>

<p>All night this was kept up, and when morning came, though
 only the clocks told it, for eternal night was below the
 surface, the rival gold-seekers were still on the trail.</p>

<p>&quot;They won't give up,&quot; declared Mr. Swift hopelessly.</p>

<p>&quot;No, we've got to race them for it, just as Berg
 proposed,&quot; admitted Tom. &quot;But if they want a straightaway
 race we'll give it to 'em Let's run her to the limit, dad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's what we've been doing, Tom.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, not exactly, for we've been submerged a little too
 much to get the best speed out of our craft. Let's go a
 little nearer the surface, and give them the best race
 they'll ever have.&quot;</p>

<p>Then the race began; and such a contest of speed as it
 was! With her propellers working to the limit, and every
 volt of electricity that was available forced into the
 forward and aft plates, the Advance surged through the
 water, about ten feet below the surface. But the Wonder kept
 after her, giving her knot for knot. The course of the
 leading submarine was easy to trace now, in the morning
 light which penetrated ten feet down.</p>

<p>&quot;No use,&quot; remarked Tom again, when, after two hours, the
 Wonder was still close behind them. &quot;Our only chance is that
 they may have a breakdown.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Or run out of air, or something like that,&quot; added Captain
 Weston. &quot;They are crowding us pretty close. I had no idea
 they could keep up this speed. If they don't look out,&quot; he
 went on as he looked from one of the aft observation
 windows, &quot;they'll foul us, and--&quot;</p>

<p>His remarks were interrupted by a jar to the Advance. She
 seemed to shiver and careened to one side. Then came another
 bump.</p>

<p>&quot;Slow down!&quot; cried the captain, rushing toward the pilot
 house.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter?&quot; asked Tom, as he threw the engines
 and electrical machines out of gear. &quot;Have we hit anything?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Something has hit us,&quot; cried the captain. &quot;Their
 submarine has rammed us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rammed us!&quot; repeated Mr. Swift. &quot;Tom, run out the
 electric cannon! They're trying to sink us! We'll have to
 fight them. Run out the stern electric gun and we'll make
 them wish they'd not followed us.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH18" id="CH18">Chapter Eighteen</a></h2>

<h3>The Electric Gun</h3>

<p> There was much excitement aboard the Advance. The
 submarine came to a stop in the water, while the treasure-seekers
 waited anxiously for what was to follow. Would they
 be rammed again? This time, stationary as they were, and
 with the other boat coming swiftly on, a hole might be stove
 through the Advance, in spite of her powerful sides.</p>

<p>They had not long to wait. Again there came a jar, and
 once more the Swifts' boat careened. But the blow was a
 glancing one and, fortunately, did little damage.</p>

<p>&quot;They certainly must be trying to sink us,&quot; agreed Captain
 Weston. &quot;Come, Tom, we'll take a look from the stern and see
 what they're up to.&quot;</p>

<p>
 &quot;And get the stern electric gun ready to fire,&quot; repeated
 Mr. Swift. &quot;We must protect ourselves. Mr. Sharp and I will
 go to the bow. There is no telling what they may do. They're
 desperate, and may ram us from in front.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom and the captain hurried aft. Through the thick plate-glass
 windows they could see the blunt nose of the Wonder
 not far away, the rival submarine having come to a halt.
 There she lay, black and silent, like some monster fish
 waiting to devour its victim.</p>

<p>&quot;There doesn't appear to be much damage done back here,&quot;
 observed Tom. &quot;No leaks. Guess they didn't puncture us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps it was due to an accident that they rammed us,&quot;
 suggested the captain.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, they wouldn't have done it if they hadn't followed
 us so close,&quot; was the opinion of the young inventor.
 &quot;They're taking too many chances. We've got to stop 'em.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is this electric gun your father speaks of?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, it's a regular electric cannon. It fires a solid
 ball, weighing about twenty-five pounds, but instead of
 powder, which would hardly do under water, and instead of
 compressed air, which is used in the torpedo tubes of the
 Government submarines, we use a current of electricity. It
 forces the cannon ball out with great energy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder what they will do next?&quot; observed the captain,
 peering through a bull'seye.</p>

<p>&quot;We can soon tell,&quot; replied the youth. &quot;We'll go ahead,
 and if they try to follow I'm going to fire on them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Suppose you sink them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I won't fire to do that; only to disable them. They
 brought it on themselves. We can't risk having them damage
 us. Help me with the cannon, will you please, captain?&quot;</p>

<p>The electric cannon was a long, steel tube in the after
 part of the submarine. It projected a slight distance from
 the sides of the ship, and by an ingenious arrangement could
 he swung around in a ball and socket joint, thus enabling it
 to shoot in almost any direction.</p>

<p>It was the work of but a few minutes to get it ready and,
 with the muzzle pointing toward the Wonder, Tom adjusted the
 electric wires and inserted the solid shot.</p>

<p>&quot;Now we're prepared for them!&quot; he cried. &quot;I think a good
 plan will be to start ahead, and if they try to follow to
 fire on them. They've brought it on themselves.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Correct,&quot; spoke Captain Weston.</p>

<p>Tom hurried forward to tell his father of this plan.</p>

<p>&quot;We'll do it!&quot; cried Mr. Swift. &quot;Go ahead, Mr. Sharp, and
 we'll see if those scoundrels will follow.&quot;</p>

<p>The young inventor returned on the run to the electric
 cannon. There was a whir of machinery, and the Advance
 moved forward. She increased her speed, and the two watchers
 in the stern looked anxiously out of the windows to see what
 their rivals would do.</p>

<p>For a moment no movement was noticeable on the part of the
 Wonder. Then, as those aboard her appeared to realize that
 the craft on which they depended to pilot them to the sunken
 treasure was slipping away, word was given to follow. The
 ship of Berg and his employers shot after the Advance.</p>

<p>&quot;Here they come!&quot; cried Captain Weston. &quot;They're going to
 ram us again!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I'm going to fire on them!&quot; declared Tom savagely.</p>

<p>On came the Wonder, nearer and nearer. Her speed was
 rapidly increasing. Suddenly she bumped the Advance, and
 then, as if it was an unavoidable accident, the rear
 submarine sheered off to one side.</p>

<p>&quot;They're certainly at it again!&quot; cried Tom, and peering
 from the bull's-eye he saw the Wonder shoot past the mouth
 of the electric cannon. &quot;Here it goes!&quot; he added.</p>

<p>He shoved over the lever, making the proper connection.
 There was no corresponding report, for the cannon was
 noiseless, but there was a slight jar as the projectile left
 the muzzle. The Wonder could be seen to heel over.</p>

<p>&quot;You hit her! You hit her!&quot; cried Captain Weston. &quot;A good
 shot!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was afraid she was past me when I pulled the lever,&quot;
 explained Tom. &quot;She went like a flash.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, you caught her on the rudder,&quot; declared the captain.
 &quot;I think you've put her out of business. Yes, they're rising
 to the surface.&quot;</p>

<p>The lad rapidly inserted another ball, and recharged the
 cannon. Then he peered out into the water, illuminated by
 the light of day overhead, as they were not far down. He
 could see the Wonder rising to the surface. Clearly
 something had happened.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe they're going to drop down on us from above, and
 try to sink us,&quot; suggested the youth, while he stood ready
 to fire again. &quot;If they do--&quot;</p>

<p>His words were interrupted by a slight jar throughout the
 submarine.</p>

<p>&quot;What was that?&quot; cried the captain.</p>

<p>&quot;Dad fired the bow gun at them, but I don't believe he hit
 them,&quot; answered the young inventor.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder what damage I did? Guess we'll go to the surface
 to find out.&quot;</p>

<p>Clearly the Wonder had given up the fight for the time
 being. In fact, she had no weapon with which to respond to a
 fusillade from her rival. Tom hastened forward and informed
 his father of what had happened.</p>

<p>&quot;If her steering gear is out of order, we may have a
 chance to slip away,&quot; said Mr. Swift &quot;We'll go up and see
 what we can learn.&quot;</p>

<p>A few minutes later Tom, his father and Captain Weston
 stepped from the conning tower, which was out of water, on
 to the little flat deck a short distance away lay the
 Wonder, and on her deck was Berg and a number of men,
 evidently members of the crew.</p>

<p>&quot;Why did you fire on us?&quot; shouted the agent angrily.</p>

<p>&quot;Why did you follow us?&quot; retorted Torn.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you've broken our rudder and disabled us,&quot; went on
 Berg, not answering the question. &quot;You'll suffer for this!
 I'll have you arrested.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You only got what you deserved,&quot; added Mr. Swift. &quot;You
 were acting illegally, following us, and you tried to sink
 us by ramming my craft before we retaliated by firing on
 you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was an accident, ramming you,&quot; said Berg. &quot;We couldn't
 help it. I now demand that you help us make repairs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you've got nerve!&quot; cried Captain Weston, his eyes
 flashing. &quot;I'd like to have a personal interview with you
 for about ten minutes. Maybe something besides your ship
 would need repairs then.&quot;</p>

<p>Berg turned away, scowling, but did not reply. He began
 directing the crew what to do about the broken rudder.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on,&quot; proposed Tom in a low voice, for sounds carry
 very easily over water. &quot;Let's go below and skip out while
 we have a chance. They can't follow now, and we can get to
 the sunken treasure ahead of them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good advice,&quot; commented his father. &quot;Come, Captain
 Weston, we'll go below and close the conning tower.&quot;</p>

<p>Five minutes later the Advance sank from sight, the last
 glimpse Tom had of Berg and his men being a sight of them
 standing on the deck of their floating boat, gazing in the
 direction of their successful rival. The Wonder was left
 behind, while Tom and his friends were soon once more
 speeding toward the treasure wreck.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH19" id="CH19">Chapter Nineteen</a></h2>

<h3>Captured</h3>

<p>&quot;Down deep,&quot; advised Captain Weston, as he stood beside
 Tom and Mr. Swift in the pilot house. &quot;As far as you can
 manage her, and then forward. We'll take no more chances
 with these fellows.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The only trouble is,&quot; replied the young inventor, &quot;that
 the deeper we go the slower we have to travel. The water is
 so dense that it holds us back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, there is no special need of hurrying now,&quot; went on
 the sailor. &quot;No one is following you, and two or three days
 difference in reaching the wreck will not amount to
 anything.&quot;</p>

<p>
 &quot;Unless they repair their rudder, and take after us
 again,&quot; suggested Mr. Swift.</p>

<p>&quot;They're not very likely to do that,&quot; was the captain's
 opinion. &quot;It was more by luck than good management that they
 picked us up before. Now, having to delay, as they will, to
 repair their steering gear, while we can go as deep as we
 please and speed ahead, it is practically impossible for
 them to catch up to us. No, I think we have nothing to fear
 from them.&quot;</p>

<p>But though danger from Berg and his crowd was somewhat
 remote, perils of another sort were hovering around the
 treasure-seekers, and they were soon to experience them.</p>

<p>It was much different from sailing along in the airship,
 Tom thought, for there was no blue sky and fleecy clouds to
 see, and they could not look down and observe, far below
 them, cities and villages. Nor could they breathe the
 bracing atmosphere of the upper regions.</p>

<p>But if there was lack of the rarefied air of the clouds,
 there was no lack of fresh atmosphere. The big tanks carried
 a large supply, and whenever more was needed the oxygen
 machine would supply it.</p>

<p>As there was no need, however, of remaining under water
 for any great stretch of time, it was their practice to rise
 every day and renew the air supply, also to float along on
 the surface for a while, or speed along, with only the
 conning tower out, in order to afford a view, and to enable
 Captain Weston to take observations. But care was always
 exercised to make sure no ships were in sight when emerging
 on the surface, for the gold-seekers did not want to be
 hailed and questioned by inquisitive persons.</p>

<p>It was about four days after the disabling of the rival
 submarine, and the Advance was speeding along about a mile
 and a half under water. Tom was in the pilot house with
 Captain Weston, Mr. Damon was at his favorite pastime of
 looking out of the glass side windows into the ocean and its
 wonders, and Mr. Swift and the balloonists were, as usual,
 in the engine-room.</p>

<p>&quot;How near do you calculate we are to the sunken wreck?&quot;
 asked Tom of his companion.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, at the calculation we made yesterday, we are within
 about a thousand miles of it now. We ought to reach it in
 about four more days, if we don't have any accidents.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And how deep do you think it is?&quot; went on the lad.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I'm afraid it's pretty close to two miles, if not
 more. It's quite a depth, and of course impossible for
 ordinary divers to reach. But it will be possible in this
 submarine and in the strong diving suits your father has
 invented for us to get to it. Yes, I don't anticipate much
 trouble in getting out the gold, once we reach the wreck of
 course--&quot;</p>

<p>The captain's remark was not finished. From the engine-room
 there came a startled shout:</p>

<p>&quot;Tom! Tom! Your father is hurt! Come here, quick!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Take the wheel!&quot; cried the lad to the captain. &quot;I must go
 to my father.&quot; It was Mr. Sharp's voice he had heard.</p>

<p>Racing to the engine-room, Tom saw his parent doubled up
 over a dynamo, while to one side, his hand on a copper
 switch, stood Mr. Sharp.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter?&quot; shouted the lad.</p>

<p>&quot;He's held there by a current of electricity,&quot; replied the
 balloonist. &quot;The wires are crossed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why don't you shut off the current?&quot; demanded the youth,
 as he prepared to pull his parent from the whirring machine.
 Then he hesitated, for he feared he, too, would be glued
 fast by the terrible current, and so be unable to help Mr.
 Swift.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm held fast here, too,&quot; replied the balloonist. &quot;I
 started to cut out the current at this switch, but there's a
 short circuit somewhere, and I can't let go, either. Quick,
 shut off all power at the main switchboard forward.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom realized that this was the only thing to do. He ran
 forward and with a yank cut out all the electric wires. With
 a sigh of relief Mr. Sharp pulled his hands from the copper
 where he had been held fast as if by some powerful magnet,
 his muscles cramped by the current. Fortunately the
 electricity was of low voltage, and he was not burned. The
 body of Mr. Swift toppled backward from the dynamo, as Tom
 sprang to reach his father.</p>

<p>&quot;He's dead!&quot; he cried, as he saw the pale face and the
 closed eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;No, only badly shocked, I hope,&quot; spoke Mr. Sharp. &quot;But we
 must get him to the fresh air at once. Start the tank pumps.
 We'll rise to the surface.&quot;</p>

<p>The youth needed no second bidding. Once more turning on
 the electric current, he set the powerful pumps in motion
 and the submarine began to rise. Then, aided by Captain
 Weston and Mr. Damon, the young inventor carried his father
 to a couch in the main cabin. Mr. Sharp took charge of the
 machinery.</p>

<p>Restoratives were applied, and there was a flutter of the
 eyelids of the aged inventor.</p>

<p>&quot;I think he'll come around all right,&quot; said the sailor
 kindly, as he saw Tom's grief. &quot;Fresh air will be the thing
 for him. We'll be on the surface in a minute.&quot;</p>

<p>Up shot the Advance, while Mr. Sharp stood ready to open
 the conning tower as soon as it should be out of water. Mr.
 Swift seemed to be rapidly reviving. With a bound the
 submarine, forced upward from the great depth, fairly shot
 out of the water. There was a clanking sound as the aeronaut
 opened the airtight door of the tower, and a breath of fresh
 air came in.</p>

<p>&quot;Can you walk, dad, or shall we carry you?&quot; asked Tom
 solitiously.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I--I'm feeling better now,&quot; was the inventor's reply.
 &quot;I'll soon be all right when I get out on deck. My foot
 slipped as I was adjusting a wire that had gotten out of
 order, and I fell so that I received a large part of the
 current. I'm glad I was not burned. Was Mr. Sharp hurt? I
 saw him run to the switch, just before I lost
 consciousness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I'm all right,&quot; answered the balloonist. &quot;But allow
 us to get you out to the fresh air. You'll feel much better
 then.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Swift managed to walk slowly to the ladder leading to
 the conning tower, and thence to the deck. The others
 followed him. As all emerged from the submarine they uttered
 a cry of astonishment.</p>

<p>There, not one hundred yards away, was a great warship,
 flying a flag which, in a moment. Tom recognized as that of
 Brazil. The cruiser was lying off a small island, and all
 about were small boats, filled with natives, who seemed to
 be bringing supplies from land to the ship. At the
 unexpected sight of the submarine, bobbing up from the
 bottom of the ocean, the natives uttered cries of fright.
 The attention of those on the warship was attracted, and the
 bridge and rails were lined with curious officers and men.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a good thing we didn't come up under that ship,&quot;
 observed Tom. &quot;They would have thought we were trying to
 torpedo her. Do you feel better, dad?&quot; he asked, his wonder
 over the sight of the big vessel temporarily eclipsed in his
 anxiety for his parent.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes, much better. I'm all right now. But I wish we
 hadn't disclosed ourselves to these people. They may demand
 to know where we are going, and Brazil is too near Uruguay
 to make it safe to tell our errand. They may guess it,
 however, from having read of the wreck, and our departure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I guess it will be all right,&quot; replied Captain
 Weston. &quot;We can tell them we are on a pleasure trip. That's
 true enough. It would give us great pleasure to find that
 gold.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's a boat, with some officers in it, to judge by the
 amount of gold lace on them, putting off from the ship,&quot;
 remarked Mr. Sharp.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha! Yes! Evidently they intend to pay us a formal visit,&quot;
 observed Mr. Damon. &quot;Bless my gaiters, though. I'm not
 dressed to receive company. I think I'll put on my dress
 suit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's too late,&quot; advised Tom. &quot;They'll be here in a
 minute.&quot;</p>

<p>Urged on by the lusty arms of the Brazilian sailors, the
 boat, containing several officers, neared the floating
 submarine rapidly.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahoy there!&quot; called an officer in the bow, his accent
 betraying his unfamiliarity with the English language. &quot;What
 craft are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Submarine, Advance, from New Jersey,&quot; replied Tom. &quot;Who
 are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Brazilian cruiser San Paulo,&quot; was the reply. &quot;Where are
 you bound?&quot; went on the officer.</p>

<p>&quot;On pleasure,&quot; answered Captain Weston quickly. &quot;But why
 do you ask? We are an American ship, sailing under American
 colors. Is this Brazilian territory?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This island is--yes,&quot; came back the answer, and by this
 time the small boat was at the side of the submarine. Before
 the adventurers could have protested, had they a desire to
 do so, there were a number of officers and the crew of the
 San Paulo on the small deck.</p>

<p>With a flourish, the officer who had done the questioning
 drew his sword. Waving it in the air with a dramatic
 gesture, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&quot;You're our prisoners! Resist and my men shall cut you
 down like dogs! Seize them, men!&quot;</p>

<p>The sailors sprang forward, each one stationing himself at
 the side of one of our friends, and grasping an arm.</p>

<p>&quot;What does this mean?&quot; cried Captain Weston indignantly.
 &quot;If this is a joke, you're carrying it too far. If you're in
 earnest, let me warn you against interfering with
 Americans!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We know what we are doing,&quot; was the answer from the
 officer.</p>

<p>The sailor who had hold of Captain Weston endeavored to
 secure a tighter grip. The captain turned suddenly, and
 seizing the man about the waist, with an exercise of
 tremendous strength hurled him over his head and into the
 sea, the man making a great splash.</p>

<p>&quot;That's the way I'll treat any one else who dares lay a
 hand on me!&quot; shouted the captain, who was transformed from a
 mild-mannered individual into an angry, modern giant. There
 was a gasp of astonishment at his feat, as the ducked sailor
 crawled back into the small boat. And he did not again
 venture on the deck of the submarine.</p>

<p>&quot;Seize them, men!&quot; cried the gold-laced officer again, and
 this time he and his fellows, including the crew, crowded so
 closely around Tom and his friends that they could do
 nothing. Even Captain Weston found it impossible to offer
 any resistance, for three men grabbed hold of him but his
 spirit was still a fighting one, and he struggled
 desperately but uselessly.</p>

<p>&quot;How dare you do this?&quot; he cried.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; added Tom, &quot;what right have you to interfere with
 us?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Every right,&quot; declared the gold-laced officer.</p>

<p>&quot;You are in Brazilian territory, and I arrest you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What for?&quot; demanded Mr. Sharp.</p>

<p>&quot;Because your ship is an American submarine, and we have
 received word that you intend to damage our shipping, and
 may try to torpedo our warships. I believe you tried to
 disable us a little while ago, but failed. We consider that
 an act of war and you will be treated accordingly. Take them
 on board the San Paulo,&quot; the officer Went on, turning to his
 aides. &quot;We'll try them by court-marital here. Some of you
 remain and guard this submarine. We will teach these
 filibustering Americans a lesson.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH20" id="CH20">Chapter Twenty</a></h2>

<h3>Doomed to Death</h3>

<p> There was no room on the small deck of the submarine to
 make a stand against the officers and crew of the Brazilian
 warship. In fact, the capture of the gold-seekers had been
 effected so suddenly that their astonishment almost deprived
 them of the power to think clearly.</p>

<p>At another command from the officer, who was addressed as
 Admiral Fanchetti, several of the sailors began to lead Tom
 and his friends toward the small boat.</p>

<p>
 &quot;Do you feel all right, father?&quot; inquired the lad
 anxiously, as he looked at his parent. &quot;These scoundrels
 have no right to treat us so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Tom, I'm all right as far as the electric shock is
 concerned, but I don't like to be handled in this fashion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We ought not to submit!&quot; burst out Mr. Damon. &quot;Bless the
 stars and stripes! We ought to fight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's no chance,&quot; said Mr. Sharp. &quot;We are right under
 the guns of the ship. They could sink us with one shot. I
 guess we'll have to give in for the time being.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is most unpleasant, if I may be allowed the
 expression,&quot; commented Captain Weston mildly. He seemed to
 have lost his sudden anger, but there was a steely glint in
 his eyes, and a grim, set look around his month that showed
 his temper was kept under control only by an effort. It
 boded no good to the sailors who had hold of the doughty
 captain if he should once get loose, and it was noticed that
 they were on their guard.</p>

<p>As for Tom, he submitted quietly to the two Brazilians who
 had hold of either arm, and Mr. Swift was held by only one,
 for it was seen that he was feeble.</p>

<p>&quot;Into the boat with them!&quot; cried Admiral Fanchetti. &quot;And
 guard them well, Lieutenant Drascalo, for I heard them
 plotting to escape,&quot; and the admiral signaled to a younger
 officer, who was in charge of the men guarding the
 prisoners.</p>

<p>&quot;Lieutenant Drascalo, eh?&quot; murmured Mr. Damon. &quot;I think
 they made a mistake naming him. It ought to be Rascalo. He
 looks like a rascal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Silenceo!&quot; exclaimed the lieutenant, scowling at the odd
 character'.</p>

<p>&quot;Bless my spark plug! He's a regular fire-eater!&quot; went on
 Mr. Damon, who appeared to have fully recovered his spirits.</p>

<p>&quot;Silenceo!&quot; cried the lieutenant, scowling again, but Mr.
 Damon did not appear to mind.</p>

<p>Admiral Fanchetti and several others of the gold-laced
 officers remained aboard the submarine, while Tom and his
 friends were hustled into the small boat and rowed toward
 the warship.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope they don't damage our craft,&quot; murmured the young
 inventor, as he saw the admiral enter the conning tower.</p>

<p>&quot;If they do, we'll complain to the United States consul
 and demand damages,&quot; said Mr. Swift.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid we won't have a chance to communicate with the
 consul,&quot; remarked Captain Weston.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Mr. Damon. &quot;Bless my shoelaces,
 but will these scoundrels--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Silenceo!&quot; cried Lieutenant Drascalo quickly. &quot;Dogs of
 Americans, do you wish to insult us?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Impossible; you wouldn't appreciate a good, genuine
 United States insult,&quot; murmured Tom under his breath.</p>

<p>&quot;What I mean,&quot; went on the captain, &quot;is that these people
 may carry the proceedings off with a high hand. You heard
 the admiral speak of a court-martial.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Would they dare do that?&quot; inquired Mr. Sharp.</p>

<p>&quot;They would dare anything in this part of the world, I'm
 afraid,&quot; resumed Captain Weston. &quot;I think I see their plan,
 though. This admiral is newly in command; his uniform shows
 that He wants to make a name for himself, and he seizes on
 our submarine as an excuse. He can send word to his
 government that he destroyed a torpedo craft that sought to
 wreck his ship. Thus he will acquire a reputation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But would his government support him in such a hostile
 act against the United States, a friendly nation?&quot; asked
 Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, he would not claim to have acted against the United
 States as a power. He would say that it was a private
 submarine, and, as a matter of fact, it is. While we are
 under the protection of the stars and stripes, our vessel is
 not a Government one,&quot; and Captain Weston spoke the last in
 a low voice, so the scowling lieutenant could not hear.</p>

<p>&quot;What will they do with us?&quot; inquired Mr. Swift.</p>

<p>&quot;Have some sort of a court-martial, perhaps,&quot; went on the
 captain, &quot;and confiscate our craft Then they will send us
 back home, I expect for they would not dare harm us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But take our submarine!&quot; cried Tom. &quot;The villains--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Silenceo!&quot; shouted Lieutenant Drascalo and he drew his
 sword.</p>

<p>By this time the small boat was under the big guns of the
 San Paulo, and the prisoners were ordered, in broken
 English, to mount a companion ladder that hung over the
 side. In a short time they were on deck, amid a crowd of
 sailors, and they could see the boat going back to bring off
 the admiral, who signaled from the submarine. Tom and his
 friends were taken below to a room that looked like a
 prison, and there, a little later, they were visited by
 Admiral Fanchetti and several officers.</p>

<p>&quot;You will be tried at once,&quot; said the admiral. &quot;I have
 examined your submarine and I find she carries two torpedo
 tubes. It is a wonder you did not sink me at once.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Those are not torpedo tubes!&quot; cried Tom, unable to keep
 silent, though Captain Weston motioned him to do so.</p>

<p>&quot;I know torpedo tubes when I see them,&quot; declared the
 admiral. &quot;I consider I had a very narrow escape. Your
 country is fortunate that mine does not declare war against
 it for this act. But I take it you are acting privately, for
 you fly no flag, though you claim to be from the United
 States.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's no place for a flag on the submarine,&quot; went on
 Tom. &quot;What good would it be under water?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Silenceo!&quot; cried Lieutenant Drascalo, the admonition to
 silence seeming to be the only command of which he was
 capable.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall confiscate your craft for my government,&quot; went on
 the admiral, &quot;and shall punish you as the court-martial may
 direct. You will be tried at once.&quot;</p>

<p>It was in vain for the prisoners to protest. Matters were
 carried with a high hand. They were allowed a spokesman, and
 Captain Weston, who understood Spanish, was selected, that
 language being used. But the defense was a farce, for he was
 scarcely listened to. Several officers testified before the
 admiral, who was judge, that they had seen the submarine
 rise out of the water, almost under the prow of the San
 Paulo. It was assumed that the Advance had tried to wreck
 the warship, but had failed. It was in vain that Captain
 Weston and the others told of the reason for their rapid
 ascent from the ocean depths--that Mr. Swift had been
 shocked, and needed fresh air. Their story was not believed.</p>

<p>&quot;We have heard enough!&quot; suddenly exclaimed the admiral.
 &quot;The evidence against you is over-whelming--er--what you
 Americans call conclusive,&quot; and be was speaking then in
 broken English. &quot;I find you guilty, and the sentence of this
 court-martial is that you be shot at sunrise, three days
 hence!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shot!&quot; cried Captain Weston, staggering back at this
 unexpected sentence. His companions turned white, and Mr.
 Swift leaned against his son for support.</p>

<p>&quot;Bless my stars! Of all the scoundrelly!&quot; began Mr. Damon.</p>

<p>&quot;Silenceo!&quot; shouted the lieutenant, waving his sword.</p>

<p>&quot;You will be shot,&quot; proceeded the admiral. &quot;Is not that
 the verdict of the honorable court?&quot; he asked, looking at
 his fellow officers. They all nodded gravely.</p>

<p>&quot;But look here!&quot; objected Captain Weston. &quot;You don't dare
 do that! We are citizens of the United States, and--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I consider you no better than pirates,&quot; interrupted the
 admiral. &quot;You have an armed submarine--a submarine with
 torpedo tubes. You invade our harbor with it, and come up
 almost under my ship. You have forfeited your right to the
 protection of your country, and I have no fear on that
 score. You will be shot within three days. That is all.
 Remove the prisoners.&quot;</p>

<p>Protests were in vain, and it was equally useless to
 struggle. The prisoners were taken out on deck, for which
 they were thankful, for the interior of the ship was close
 and hot, the weather being intensely disagreeable. They were
 told to keep within a certain space on deck, and a guard of
 sailors, all armed, was placed near them. From where they
 were they could see their submarine floating on the surface
 of the little bay, with several Brazilians on the small
 deck. The Advance had been anchored, and was surrounded by a
 flotilla of the native boats, the brown-skinned paddlers
 gazing curiously at the odd craft.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, this is tough luck!&quot; murmured Tom. &quot;How do you
 feel, dad?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As well as can be expected under the circumstances,&quot; was
 the reply. &quot;What do you think about this, Captain Weston?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not very much, if I may be allowed the expression,&quot; was
 the answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think they will dare carry out that threat?&quot; asked
 Mr. Sharp.</p>

<p>The captain shrugged his shoulders. &quot;I hope it is only a
 bluff,&quot; he replied, &quot;made to scare us so we will consent to
 giving up the submarine, which they have no right to
 confiscate. But these fellows look ugly enough for
 anything,&quot; he went on.</p>

<p>&quot;Then if there's any chance of them attempting to carry it
 out,&quot; spoke Tom, &quot;we've got to do something.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bless my gizzard, of course!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Damon. &quot;But
 what? That's the question. To be shot! Why, that's a
 terrible threat! The villains--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Silenceo!&quot; shouted Lieutenant Drascalo, coming up at that  moment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH21" id="CH21">Chapter Twenty-One</a></h2>

<h3>The Escape</h3>

<p> Events had happened so quickly that day that the gold-hunters 
could scarcely comprehend them. It seemed only a
 short time since Mr. Swift had been discovered lying
 disabled on the dynamo, and what had transpired since seemed
 to have taken place in a few minutes, though it was, in
 reality, several hours. This was made manifest by the
 feeling of hunger on the part of Tom and his friends.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder if they're going to starve us, the scoundrels?&quot;
 asked Mr. Sharp, when the irate lieutenant was beyond
 hearing. &quot;It's not fair to make us go hungry and shoot us in
 the bargain.&quot;</p>

<p>
 &quot;That's so, they ought to feed us,&quot; put in Tom. As yet
 neither he nor the others fully realized the meaning of the
 sentence passed on them.</p>

<p>From where they were on deck they could look off to the
 little island. From it boats manned by natives were
 constantly putting off, bringing supplies to the ship. The
 place appeared to be a sort of calling station for Brazilian
 warships, where they could get fresh water and fruit and
 other food.</p>

<p>From the island the gaze of the adventurers wandered to
 the submarine, which lay not far away. They were chagrined
 to see several of the bolder natives clambering over the
 deck.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope they keep out of the interior,&quot; commented Tom. &quot;If
 they get to pulling or hauling on the levers and wheels they
 may open the tanks and sink her, with the Conning tower
 open.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Better that, perhaps, than to have her fall into the
 hands of a foreign power,&quot; commented Captain Weston.
 &quot;Besides, I don't see that it's going to matter much to us
 what becomes of her after we're--&quot;</p>

<p>He did not finish, but every one knew what he meant, and a
 grim silence fell upon the little group.</p>

<p>There came a welcome diversion, however, in the shape of
 three sailors, bearing trays of food, which were placed on
 the deck in front of the prisoners, who were sitting or
 lying in the shade of an awning, for the sun was very hot.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha! Bless my napkin-ring!&quot; cried Mr. Damon with something
 of his former gaiety. &quot;Here's a meal, at all events. They
 don't intend to starve us. Eat hearty, every one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, we need to keep up our strength,&quot; observed Captain
 Weston.</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; inquired Mr. Sharp.</p>

<p>&quot;Because we're going to try to escape!&quot; exclaimed Tom in a
 low voice, when the sailors who had brought the food had
 gone. &quot;Isn't that what you mean, captain?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly. We'll try to give these villains the slip, and
 we'll need all our strength and wits to do it. We'll wait
 until night, and see what we can do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But where will we escape to?&quot; asked Mr. Swift. &quot;The
 island will afford no shelter, and--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, but our submarine will,&quot; went on the sailor.</p>

<p>&quot;It's in the possession of the Brazilians,&quot; objected Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;Once I get aboard the Advance twenty of those brown-skinned
 villains won't keep me prisoner,&quot; declared Captain
 Weston fiercely. &quot;If we can only slip away from here, get
 into the small boat, or even swim to the submarine, I'll
 make those chaps on board her think a hurricane has broken
 loose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and I'll help,&quot; said Mr. Damon.</p>

<p>&quot;And I,&quot; added Tom and the balloonist.</p>

<p>&quot;That's the way to talk,&quot; commented the captain. &quot;Now
 let's eat, for I see that rascally lieutenant coming this
 way, and we mustn't appear to be plotting, or he'll be
 suspicious.&quot;</p>

<p>The day passed slowly, and though the prisoners seemed to
 be allowed considerable liberty, they soon found that it was
 only apparent. Once Tom walked some distance from that
 portion of the deck where he and the others had been told to
 remain. A sailor with a gun at once ordered him back. Nor
 could they approach the rails without being directed,
 harshly enough at times, to move back amidships.</p>

<p>As night approached the gold-seekers were on the alert for
 any chance that might offer to slip away, or even attack
 their guard, but the number of Brazilians around them was
 doubled in the evening, and after supper, which was served
 to them on deck by the light of swinging lanterns, they were
 taken below and locked in a stuffy cabin. They looked
 helplessly at each other.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't give up,&quot; advised Captain Weston. &quot;It's a long
 night. We may be able to get out of here.&quot;</p>

<p>But this hope was in vain. Several times he and Tom,
 thinking the guards outside the cabin were asleep, tried to
 force the lock of the door with their pocket-knives, which
 had not been taken from them. But one of the sailors was
 aroused each time by the noise, and looked in through a
 barred window, so they had to give it up. Slowly the night
 passed, and morning found the prisoners pale, tired and
 discouraged. They were brought up on deck again, for which
 they were thankful, as in that tropical climate it was
 stifling below.</p>

<p>During the day they saw Admiral Fanchetti and several of
 his officers pay a visit to the submarine. They went below
 through the opened conning tower, and were gone some time.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope they don't disturb any of the machinery,&quot; remarked
 Mr. Swift. &quot;That could easily do great damage.&quot;</p>

<p>Admiral Fanchetti seemed much pleased with himself when he
 returned from his visit to the submarine.</p>

<p>&quot;You have a fine craft,&quot; he said to the prisoners. &quot;Or,
 rather, you had one. My government now owns it. It seems a
 pity to shoot such good boat builders, but you are too
 dangerous to be allowed to go.&quot;</p>

<p>If there had been any doubt in the minds of Tom and his
 friends that the sentence of the court-martial was only for
 effect, it was dispelled that day. A firing squad was told
 off in plain view of them, and the men were put through
 their evolutions by Lieutenant Drascalo, who had them load,
 aim and fire blank cartridges at an imaginary line of
 prisoners. Tom could not repress a shudder as he noted the
 leveled rifles, and saw the fire and smoke spurt from the
 muzzles.</p>

<p>&quot;Thus we shall do to you at sunrise to-morrow,&quot; said the
 lieutenant, grinning, as he once more had his men practice
 their grim work.</p>

<p>It seemed hotter than ever that day. The sun was fairly
 broiling, and there was a curious haziness and stillness to
 the air. It was noticed that the sailors on the San Paulo
 were busy making fast all loose articles on deck with extra
 lashings, and hatch coverings were doubly secured.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you suppose they are up to?&quot; asked Tom of Captain
 Weston.</p>

<p>&quot;I think it is coming on to blow,&quot; he replied, &quot;and they
 don't want to be caught napping. They have fearful storms
 down in this region at this season of the year, and I think
 one is about due.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope it doesn't wreck the submarine,&quot; spoke Mr. Swift.
 &quot;They ought to close the hatch of the conning tower, for it
 won't take much of a sea to make her ship considerable
 water.&quot;</p>

<p>Admiral Fanchetti had thought of this, however, and as the
 afternoon wore away and the storm signs multiplied, he sent
 word to close the submarine. He left a few sailors aboard
 inside on guard.</p>

<p>&quot;It's too hot to eat,&quot; observed Tom, when their supper had
 been brought to them, and the others felt the same way about
 it. They managed to drink some cocoanut milk, prepared in a
 palatable fashion by the natives of the island, and then,
 much to their disgust, they were taken below again and
 locked in the cabin.</p>

<p>&quot;Whew! But it certainly is hot!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Damon as he
 sat down on a couch and fanned himself. &quot;This is awful!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, something is going to happen pretty soon,&quot; observed
 Captain Weston. &quot;The storm will break shortly, I think.&quot;</p>

<p>They sat languidly about the cabin. It was so oppressive
 that even the thought of the doom that awaited them in the
 morning could hardly seem worse than the terrible heat. They
 could hear movements going on about the ship, movements
 which indicated that preparations were being made for
 something unusual. There was a rattling of a chain through a
 hawse hole, and Captain Weston remarked:</p>

<p>&quot;They're putting down another anchor. Admiral Fanchetti
 had better get away from the island, though, unless he wants
 to be wrecked. He'll be blown ashore in less than no time. No
 cable or chain will hold in such storms as they have here.&quot;</p>

<p>There came a period of silence, which was suddenly broken
 by a howl as of some wild beast.</p>

<p>&quot;What's that?&quot; cried Tom, springing up from where he was
 stretched out on the cabin floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Only the wind,&quot; replied the captain. &quot;The storm has
 arrived.&quot;</p>

<p>The howling kept up, and soon the ship began to rock. The
 wind increased, and a little later there could be heard,
 through an opened port in the prisoners' cabin, the dash of
 rain.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a regular hurricane!&quot; exclaimed the captain. &quot;I
 wonder if the cables will hold?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What about the submarine?&quot; asked Mr. Swift anxiously.</p>

<p>&quot;I haven't much fear for her. She lies so low in the water
 that the wind can't get much hold on her. I don't believe
 she'll drag her anchor.&quot;</p>

<p>Once more came a fierce burst of wind, and a
 dash of rain, and then, suddenly above the outburst of the
 elements, there sounded a crash on deck. It was followed by
 excited cries.</p>

<p>&quot;Something's happened!&quot; yelled Tom. The prisoners gathered
 in a frightened group in the middle of the cabin. The cries
 were repeated, and then came a rush of feet just outside the
 cabin door.</p>

<p>&quot;Our guards! They're leaving!&quot; shouted Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;Right!&quot; exclaimed Captain Weston. &quot;Now's our chance! Come
 on! If we're going to escape we must do it while the storm
 is at its height, and all is in confusion. Come on!&quot;</p>

<p>Tom tried the door. It was locked.</p>

<p>&quot;One side!&quot; shouted the captain, and this time he did not
 pause to say &quot;by your leave.&quot; He came at the portal on the
 run, and his shoulder struck it squarely. There was a
 splintering and crashing of wood, and the door was burst
 open.</p>

<p>&quot;Follow me!&quot; cried the valiant sailor, and Tom and the
 others rushed after him. They could hear the wind howling
 more loudly than ever, and as they reached the deck the rain
 dashed into their faces with such violence that they could
 hardly see. But they were aware that something had occurred.
 By the light of several lanterns swaying in the terrific
 blast they saw that one of the auxiliary masts had broken
 off near the deck.</p>

<p>It had fallen against the chart house, smashing it, and a
 number of sailors were laboring to clear away the wreckage.</p>

<p>&quot;Fortune favors us!&quot; cried Captain Weston. &quot;Come on! Make
 for the small boat. It's near the side ladder. We'll lower
 the boat and pull to the submarine.&quot;</p>

<p>There came a flash of lightning, and in its glare Tom saw
 something that caused him to cry out.</p>

<p>&quot;Look!&quot; he shouted. &quot;The submarine. She's dragged her
 anchors!&quot;</p>

<p>The Advance was much closer to the warship than she had
 been that afternoon. Captain Weston looked over the side.</p>

<p>&quot;It's the San Paulo that's dragging her anchors, not the
 submarine!&quot; he shouted. &quot;We're bearing down on her! We must
 act quickly. Come on, we'll lower the boat!&quot;</p>

<p>In the rush of wind and the dash of rain the prisoners
 crowded to the accommodation companion ladder, which was
 still over the side of the big ship. No one seemed to be
 noticing them, for Admiral Fanchetti was on the bridge,
 yelling orders for the clearing away of the wreckage. But
 Lieutenant Drascalo, coming up from below at that moment,
 caught sight of the fleeing ones. Drawing his sword, he
 rushed at them, shouting:</p>

<p>&quot;The prisoners! The prisoners! They are escaping!&quot;</p>

<p>Captain Weston leaped toward the lieutenant</p>

<p>&quot;Look out for his sword!&quot; cried Tom. But the doughty
 sailor did not fear the weapon. Catching up a coil of rope,
 he cast it at the lieutenant. It struck him in the chest,
 and he staggered back, lowering his sword.</p>

<p>Captain Weston leaped forward, and with a terrific blow
 sent Lieutenant Drascalo to the deck.</p>

<p>&quot;There!&quot; cried the sailor. &quot;I guess you won't yell
 'Silenceo!' for a while now.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a rush of Brazilians toward the group of
 prisoners. Tom caught one with a blow on the chin, and
 felled him, while Captain Weston disposed of two more, and
 Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon one each. The savage fighting of the
 Americans was too much for the foreigners, and they drew
 back.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on!&quot; cried Captain Weston again. &quot;The storm is
 getting worse. The warship will crash into the submarine in
 a few minutes. Her anchors aren't holding. I didn't think
 they would.&quot;</p>

<p>He made a dash for the ladder, and a glance showed him
 that the small boat was in the water at the foot of it. The
 craft had not been hoisted on the davits.</p>

<p>&quot;Luck's with us at last!&quot; cried Tom, Seeing it also.
 &quot;Shall I help you, dad?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; I think I'm all right. Go ahead.&quot;</p>

<p>There came such a gust of wind that the San Paulo was
 heeled over, and the wreck of the mast, rolling about,
 crashed into the side of a deck house, splintering it. A
 crowd of sailors, led by Admiral Fanchetti, who were again
 rushing on the escaping prisoners, had to leap back out of
 the way of the rolling mast.</p>

<p>&quot;Catch them! Don't let them get away!&quot; begged the
 commander, but the sailors evidently had no desire to close
 in with the Americans.</p>

<p>Through the rush of wind and rain Tom and his friends
 staggered down the ladder. It was hard work to maintain
 one's footing, but they managed it. On account of the high
 side of the ship the water was comparatively calm under her
 lee, and, though the small boat was bobbing about, they got
 aboard. The oars were in place, and in another moment they
 had shoved off from the landing stage which formed the foot
 of the accommodation ladder.</p>

<p>&quot;Now for the Advance!&quot; murmured Captain Weston.</p>

<p>&quot;Come back! Come back, dogs of Americans!&quot; cried a voice
 at the rail over their heads, and looking up, Tom saw
 Lieutenant Drascalo. He had snatched a carbine from a
 marine, and was pointing it at the recent prisoners. He
 fired, the flash of the gun and a dazzling chain of
 lightning coming together. The thunder swallowed up the
 report of the carbine, but the bullet whistled uncomfortable
 close to Tom's head. The blackness that followed the
 lightning shut out the view of everything for a few seconds,
 and when the next flash came the adventurers saw that they
 were close to their submarine.</p>

<p>A fusillade of shots sounded from the deck of the warship,
 but as the marines were poor marksmen at best, and as the
 swaying of the ship disconcerted them, our friends were in
 little danger.</p>

<p>There was quite a sea once they were beyond the protection
 of the side of the warship, but Captain Weston, who was
 rowing, knew how to manage a boat skillfully, and he soon had
 the craft alongside the bobbing submarine.</p>

<p>&quot;Get aboard, now, quick!&quot; he cried.</p>

<p>They leaped to the small deck, casting the rowboat adrift.
 It was the work of but a moment to open the conning tower.
 As they started to descend they were met by several
 Brazilians coming up.</p>

<p>&quot;Overboard with 'em!&quot; yelled the captain. &quot;Let them swim
 ashore or to their ship!&quot;</p>

<p>With almost superhuman strength he tossed one big sailor
 from the small deck. Another showed fight, but he went to
 join his companion in the swirling water. A man rushed at
 Tom, seeking the while to draw his sword, but the young
 inventor, with a neat left-hander, sent him to join the
 other two, and the remainder did not wait to try
 conclusions. They leaped for their lives, and soon all could
 be seen, in the frequent lightning flashes, swimming toward
 the warship which was now closer than ever to the submarine.</p>

<p>&quot;Get inside and we'll sink below the surface!&quot; called Tom.
 &quot;Then we don't care what happens.&quot;</p>

<p>They closed the steel door of the conning tower. As they
 did so they heard the patter of bullets from carbines fired
 from the San Paulo. Then came a violent tossing of the
 Advance; the waves were becoming higher as they caught the
 full force of the hurricane. It took but an instant to
 sever, from within, the cable attached to the anchor, which
 was one belonging to the warship. The Advance began
 drifting.</p>

<p>&quot;Open the tanks, Mr. Sharp!&quot; cried Tom. &quot;Captain Weston
 and I will steer. Once below we'll start the engines.&quot;</p>

<p>Amid a crash of thunder and dazzling flashes of lightning,
 the submarine began to sink. Tom, in the conning tower had a
 sight of the San Paulo as it drifted nearer and nearer under
 the influence of the mighty wind. As one bright flash came
 he saw Admiral Fanchetti and Lieutenant Drascalo leaning
 over the rail and gazing at the Advance.</p>

<p>A moment later the view faded from sight as the submarine
 sank below the surface of the troubled sea. She was tossed
 about for some time until deep enough to escape the surface
 motion. Waiting until she was far enough down so that her
 lights would not offer a mark for the guns of the warship,
 the electrics were switched on.</p>

<p>&quot;We're safe now!&quot; cried Tom, helping his father to his
 cabin. &quot;They've got too much to attend to themselves to
 follow us now, even if they could. Shall we go ahead,
 Captain Weston?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think so, yes, if I may be allowed to express my
 opinion,&quot; was the mild reply, in strange contrast to the
 strenuous work in which the captain had just been engaged.</p>

<p>Tom signaled to Mr. Sharp in the engine-room, and in a few
 seconds the Advance was speeding away from the island and
 the hostile vessel. Nor, deep as she was now, was there any
 sign of the hurricane. In the peaceful depths she was once
 more speeding toward the sunken treasure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH22" id="CH22">Chapter Twenty-Two</a></h2>

<h3>At the Wreck</h3>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; remarked Mr. Damon, as the submarine hurled
 herself forward through the ocean, &quot;I guess that firing
 party will have something else to do to-morrow morning
 besides aiming those rifles at us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; agreed Tom. &quot;They'll be lucky if they save
 their ship. My, how that wind did blow!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're right,&quot; put in Captain Weston. &quot;When they get a
 hurricane down in this region it's no cat's paw. But they
 were a mighty careless lot of sailors. The idea of leaving
 the ladder over the side, and the boat in the water.&quot;</p>

<p>
 &quot;It was a good thing for us, though,&quot; was Tom's opinion.</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed it was,&quot; came from the captain. &quot;But as long as we
 are safe now I think we'd better take a look about the craft
 to see if those chaps did any damage. They can't have done
 much, though, or she wouldn't be running so smoothly.
 Suppose you go take a look, Tom, and ask your father and Mr.
 Sharp what they think. I'll steer for a while, until we get
 well away from the island.&quot;</p>

<p>The young inventor found his father and the balloonist
 busy in the engine-room. Mr. Swift had already begun an
 inspection of the machinery, and so far found that it had
 not been injured. A further inspection showed that no damage
 had been done by the foreign guard that had been in
 temporary possession of the Advance, though the sailors had
 made free in the cabins, and had broken into the food
 lockers, helping themselves plentifully. But there was still
 enough for the gold-seekers.</p>

<p>&quot;You'd never know there was a storm raging up above,&quot;
 observed Tom as he rejoined Captain Weston in the lower
 pilot house, where he was managing the craft. &quot;It's as
 still and peaceful here as one could wish.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, the extreme depths are seldom disturbed by a surface
 storm. But we are over a mile deep now. I sent her down a
 little while you were gone, as I think she rides a little
 more steadily.&quot;</p>

<p>All that night they speeded forward, and the next day,
 rising to the surface to take an observation, they found no
 traces of the storm, which had blown itself out. They were
 several hundred miles away from the hostile warship, and
 there was not a vessel in sight on the broad expanse of blue
 ocean.</p>

<p>The air tanks were refilled, and after sailing along on
 the surface for an hour or two, the submarine was again sent
 below, as Captain Weston sighted through his telescope the
 smoke of a distant steamer.</p>

<p>&quot;As long as it isn't the Wonder, we're all right,&quot; said
 Tom. &quot;Still, we don't want to answer a lot of questions
 about ourselves and our object.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. I fancy the Wonder will give up the search,&quot; remarked
 the captain, as the Advance was sinking to the depths.</p>

<p>&quot;We must be getting pretty near to the end of our search
 ourselves,&quot; ventured the young inventor.</p>

<p>&quot;We are within five hundred miles of the intersection of
 the forty-fifth parallel and the twenty-seventh meridian,
 east from Washington,&quot; said the captain. &quot;That's as near as
 I could locate the wreck. Once we reach that point we will
 have to search about under water, for I don't fancy the
 other divers left any buoys to mark the spot.&quot;</p>

<p>It was two days later, after uneventful sailing, partly on
 the surface, and partly submerged, that Captain Weston,
 taking a noon observation, announced:</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we're here!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you mean at the wreck?&quot; asked Mr. Swift eagerly.</p>

<p>&quot;We're at the place where she is supposed to lie, in about
 two miles of water,&quot; replied the captain. &quot;We are quite a
 distance off the coast of Uruguay, about opposite the harbor
 of Rio de La Plata. From now on we shall have to nose about
 under water, and trust to luck.&quot;</p>

<p>With her air tanks filled to their capacity, and Tom
 having seen that the oxygen machine and other apparatus was
 in perfect working order, the submarine was sent below on
 her search. Though they were in the neighborhood of the
 wreck, the adventurers might still have to do considerable
 searching before locating it. Lower and lower they sank into
 the depths of the sea, down and down, until they were deeper
 than they had ever gone before. The pressure was tremendous,
 but the steel sides of the Advance withstood it</p>

<p>Then began a search that lasted nearly a week. Back and
 forth they cruised, around in great circles, with the
 powerful searchlight focused to disclose the sunken treasure
 ship. Once Tom, who was observing the path of light in the
 depths from the conning tower, thought he had seen the
 remains of the Boldero, for a misty shape loomed up in front
 of the submarine, and he signaled for a quick stop. It was a
 wreck, but it had been on the ocean bed for a score of
 years, and only a few timbers remained of what had been a
 great ship. Much disappointed, Tom rang for full speed ahead
 again, and the current was sent into the great electric
 plates that pulled and pushed the submarine forward.</p>

<p>For two days more nothing happened. They searched around
 under the green waters, on the alert for the first sign, but
 they saw nothing. Great fish swam about them, sometimes
 racing with the Advance. The adventurers beheld great ocean
 caverns, and skirted immense rocks, where dwelt monsters of
 the deep. Once a great octopus tried to do battle with the
 submarine and crush it in its snaky arms, but Tom saw the
 great white body, with saucer-shaped eyes, in the path of
 light and rammed him with the steel point. The creature died
 after a struggle.</p>

<p>They were beginning to despair when a full week had passed
 and they were seemingly as far from the wreck as ever. They
 went to the surface to enable Captain Weston to take another
 observation. It only confirmed the other, and showed that
 they were in the right vicinity. But it was like looking for
 a needle in a haystack, almost, to and the sunken ship in
 that depth of water.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we'll try again,&quot; said Mr. Swift, as they sank once
 more beneath the surface.</p>

<p>It was toward evening, on the second day after this, that
 Tom, who was on duty in the conning tower, saw a black shape
 looming up in front of the submarine, the searchlight
 revealing it to him far enough away so that he could steer
 to avoid it. He thought at first that it was a great rock,
 for they were moving along near the bottom, but the peculiar
 shape of it soon convinced him that this could not be. It
 came more plainly into view as the submarine approached it
 more slowly, then suddenly, out of the depths in the
 illumination from the searchlight, the young inventor saw
 the steel sides of a steamer. His heart gave a great thump,
 but he would not call out yet, fearing that it might be some
 other vessel than the one containing the treasure.</p>

<p>He steered the Advance so as to circle it. As he swept
 past the bows he saw in big letters near the sharp prow the
 word, Boldero.</p>

<p>&quot;The wreck! The wreck!&quot; he cried, his voice ringing
 through the craft from end to end. &quot;We've found the wreck at
 last!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot; cried his father, hurrying to his son,
 Captain Weston following.</p>

<p>&quot;Positive,&quot; answered the lad. The submarine was slowing up
 now, and Tom sent her around on the other side. They had a
 good view of the sunken ship. It seemed to be intact, no
 gaping holes in her sides, for only her plates had started,
 allowing her to sink gradually.</p>

<p>&quot;At last,&quot; murmured Mr. Swift. &quot;Can it be possible we are
 about to get the treasure?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's the Boldero, all right,&quot; affirmed Captain Weston.
 &quot;I recognize her, even if the name wasn't on her bow. Go
 right down on the bottom, Tom, and we'll get out the diving
 suits and make an examination.&quot;</p>

<p>The submarine settled to the ocean bed. Tom glanced at the
 depth gage. It showed over two miles and a half. Would they
 be able to venture out into water of such enormous pressure
 in the comparatively frail diving suits, and wrest the gold
 from the wreck? It was a serious question.</p>

<p>The Advance came to a stop. In front of her loomed the
 great bulk of the Boldero, vague and shadowy in the
 flickering gleam of the searchlight As the gold-seekers
 looked at her through the bull's-eyes of the conning tower,
 several great forms emerged from beneath the wreck's bows.</p>

<p>&quot;Deep-water sharks!&quot; exclaimed Captain Weston, &quot;and
 monsters, too. But they can't bother us. Now to get out the
 gold!&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH23" id="CH23">Chapter Twenty-Three</a></h2>

<h3>Attacked by Sharks</h3>

<p> For a few minutes after reaching the wreck, which had so
 occupied their thoughts for the past weeks, the adventurers
 did nothing but gaze at it from the ports of the submarine.
 The appearance of the deep-water sharks gave them no
 concern, for they did not imagine the ugly creatures would
 attack them. The treasure-seekers were more engrossed with
 the problem of getting out the gold.</p>

<p>
 &quot;How are we going to get at it?&quot; asked Tom, as he looked
 at the high sides of the sunken ship, which towered well
 above the comparatively small Advance.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, just go in and get it,&quot; suggested Mr. Damon. &quot;Where
 is gold in a cargo usually kept, Captain Weston? You ought
 to know, I should think. Bless my pocketbook!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I should say that in this case the bullion would be
 kept in a safe in the captain's cabin,&quot; replied the sailor.
 &quot;Or, if not there, in some after part of the vessel, away
 from where the crew is quartered. But it is going to be
 quite a problem to get at it. We can't climb the sides of
 the wreck, and it will be impossible to lower her ladder
 over the side. However, I think we had better get into the
 diving suits and take a closer look. We can walk around
 her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's my idea,&quot; put in Mr. Sharp. &quot;But who will go, and
 who will stay with the ship?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think Tom and Captain Weston had better go,&quot; suggested
 Mr. Swift. &quot;Then, in case anything happens, Mr. Sharp, you
 and I will be on board to manage matters.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't think anything will happen, do you, dad?&quot; asked
 his son with a laugh, but it was not an easy one, for the
 lad was thinking of the shadowy forms of the ugly sharks.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no, but it's best to be prepared,&quot; answered his
 father.</p>

<p>The captain and the young inventor lost no time in donning
 the diving suits. They each took a heavy metal bar, pointed
 at one end, to use in assisting them to walk on the bed of
 the ocean, and as a protection in case the sharks might
 attack them. Entering the diving chamber, they were shut in,
 and then water was admitted until the pressure was seen, by
 gauges, to be the same as that outside the submarine. Then
 the sliding steel door was opened. At first Tom and the
 captain could barely move, so great was the pressure of
 water on their bodies. They would have been crushed but for
 the protection afforded by the strong diving suits.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they became used to it, and stepped out
 on the floor of the ocean. They could not, of course, speak
 to each other, but Tom looked through the glass eyes of his
 helmet at the captain, and the latter motioned for the lad
 to follow. The two divers could breathe perfectly, and by
 means of small, but powerful lights on the helmets, the way
 was lighted for them as they advanced.</p>

<p>Slowly they approached the wreck, and began a circuit of
 her. They could see several places where the pressure of the
 water, and the strain of the storm in which she had
 foundered, had 'opened the plates of the ship, but in no
 case were the openings large enough to admit a person.
 Captain Weston put his steel bar in one crack, and tried to
 pry it farther open, but his strength was not equal to the
 task. He made some peculiar motions, but Tom could not
 understand them.</p>

<p>They looked for some means by which they could mount to
 the decks of the Boldero, but none was visible. It was like
 trying to scale a fifty-foot smooth steel wall. There was no
 place for a foothold. Again the sailor made some peculiar
 motions, and the lad puzzled over them. They had gone nearly
 around the wreck now, and as yet had seen no way in which to
 get at the gold. As they passed around the bow, which was in
 a deep shadow from a great rock, they caught sight of the
 submarine lying a short distance away. Light streamed from
 many hull's-eyes, and Tom felt a sense of security as he
 looked at her, for it was lonesome enough in that great
 depth of water, unable to speak to his companion, who was a
 few feet in advance.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a swirling of the water, and Tom was
 nearly thrown off his feet by the rush of some great body. A
 long, black shadow passed over his head, and an instant
 later he saw the form of a great shark launched at Captain
 Weston. The lad involuntarily cried in alarm, but the result
 was surprising. He was nearly deafened by his own voice,
 confined as the sound was in the helmet he wore. But the
 sailor, too, had felt the movement of the water, and turned
 just in time. He thrust upward with his pointed bar. But he
 missed the stroke, and Tom, a moment later, saw the great
 fish turn over so that its mouth, which is far underneath
 its snout, could take in the queer shape which the shark
 evidently thought was a choice morsel. The big fish did
 actually get the helmet of Captain Weston inside its jaws,
 but probably it would have found it impossible to crush the
 strong steel. Still it might have sprung the joints, and
 water would have entered, which would have been as fatal as
 though the sailor had been swallowed by the shark. Tom
 realized this and, moving as fast as he could through the
 water, he came up behind the monster and drove his steel bar
 deep into it.</p>

<p>The sea was crimsoned with blood, and the savage creature,
 opening its mouth, let go of the captain. It turned on Tom,
 who again harpooned it. Then the fish darted off and began a
 wild flurry, for it was dying. The rush of water nearly
 threw Tom off his feet, but he managed to make his way over
 to his friend, and assist him to rise. A confident look from
 the sailor showed the lad that Captain Weston was uninjured,
 though he must have been frightened. As the two turned to
 make their way back to the submarine, the waters about them
 seemed alive with the horrible monsters.</p>

<p>It needed but a glance to show what they were, Sharks!
 Scores of them, long, black ones, with their ugly, undershot
 mouths. They had been attracted by the blood of the one Tom
 had killed, but there was not a meal for all of them off the
 dying creature, and the great fish might turn on the young
 inventor and his companion.</p>

<p>The two shrank closer toward the wreck. They might get
 under the prow of that and be safe. But even as they started
 to move, several of the sea wolves darted quickly at them.
 Tom glanced at the captain. What could they do? Strong as
 were the diving suits, a combined attack by the sharks, with
 their powerful jaws, would do untold damage.</p>

<p>At that moment there seemed some movement on board the
 submarine. Tom could see his father looking from the conning
 tower, and the aged inventor seemed to be making some
 motions. Then Tom understood. Mr. Swift was directing his
 son and Captain Weston to crouch down. The lad did so,
 pulling the sailor after him. Then Tom saw the bow electric
 gun run out, and aimed at the mass of sharks, most of whom
 were congregated about the dead one. Into the midst of the
 monsters was fired a number of small projectiles, which
 could be used in the electric cannon in place of the solid
 shot. Once more the waters were red with blood, and those
 sharks which were not killed swirled off. Tom and Captain
 Weston were saved. They were soon inside the submarine
 again, telling their thrilling story.</p>

<p>&quot;It's lucky you saw us, dad,&quot; remarked the lad, blushing
 at the praise Mr. Damon bestowed on him for killing the
 monster which had attacked the captain.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I was on the lookout,&quot; said the inventor. &quot;But what
 about getting into the wreck?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think the only way we can do it will be to ram a hole
 in her side,&quot; said Captain Weston. &quot;That was what I tried to
 tell Tom by motions, but he didn't seem to understand me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; replied the lad, who was still a little nervous from
 his recent experience. &quot;I thought you meant for us to turn
 it over, bottom side up,&quot; and he laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;Bless my gizzard! Just like a shark,&quot; commented Mr.
 Damon.</p>

<p>&quot;Please don't mention them,&quot; begged Tom. &quot;I hope we don't
 see any more of them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I fancy they have been driven far enough away from
 this neighborhood now,&quot; commented the captain. &quot;But now
 about the wreck. We may be able to approach it from above.
 Suppose we try to lower the submarine on it? That will save
 ripping it open.&quot;</p>

<p>This was tried a little later, but would not work. There
 were strong currents sweeping over the top of the Boldero,
 caused by a submerged reef near which she had settled. It
 was a delicate task to sink the submarine on her decks, and
 with the deep waters swirling about was found to be
 impossible, even with the use of the electric plates and the
 auxiliary screws. Once more the Advance settled to the ocean
 bed, near the wreck.</p>

<p>
 &quot;Well, what's to be done?&quot; asked Tom, as he looked at the
 high steel sides.</p>

<p>&quot;Ram her, tear a hole, and then use dynamite,&quot; decided
 Captain Weston promptly. &quot;You have some explosive, haven't
 you, Mr. Swift?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes. I came prepared for emergencies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then we'll blow up the wreck and get at the gold.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH24" id="CH24">Chapter Twenty-Four</a></h2>

<h3>Ramming the Wreck</h3>

<p> Fitted with a long, sharp steel ram in front, the Advance
 was peculiarly adapted for this sort of work. In designing
 the ship this ram was calculated to be used against hostile
 vessels in war time, for the submarine was at first, as we
 know, destined for a Government boat. Now the ram was to
 serve a good turn.</p>

<p>To make sure that the attempt would be a success, the
 machinery of the craft was carefully gone over. It was found
 to be in perfect order, save for a few adjustments which
 were needed. Then, as it was night, though there was no
 difference in the appearance of things below the surface, it
 was decided to turn in, and begin work in the morning. Nor
 did the gold-seekers go to the surface, for they feared they
 might encounter a storm.</p>

<p>
 &quot;We had trouble enough locating the wreck,&quot; said Captain
 Weston, &quot;and if we go up we may be blown off our course. We
 have air enough to stay below, haven't we, Tom?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Plenty,&quot; answered the lad, looking at the gages.</p>

<p>After a hearty breakfast the next morning, the submarine
 crew got ready for their hard task. The craft was backed
 away as far as was practical, and then, running at full
 speed, she rammed the wreck. The shock was terrific, and at
 first it was feared some damage had been done to the
 Advance, but she stood the strain.</p>

<p>&quot;Did we open up much of a hole?&quot; anxiously asked Mr.
 Swift.</p>

<p>&quot;Pretty good,&quot; replied Tom, observing it through the
 conning tower bull's-eyes, when the submarine had backed off
 again. &quot;Let's give her another.&quot;</p>

<p>Once more the great steel ram hit into the side of the
 Boldero, and again the submarine shivered from the shock.
 But there was a bigger hole in the wreck now, and after
 Captain Weston had viewed it he decided it was large enough
 to allow a person to enter and place a charge of dynamite so
 that the treasure ship would be broken up.</p>

<p>Tom and the captain placed the explosive. Then the Advance
 was withdrawn to a safe distance. There was a dull rumble, a
 great swirling of the water, which was made murky; but when
 it cleared, and the submarine went back, it was seen that
 the wreck was effectively broken up. It was in two parts,
 each one easy of access.</p>

<p>&quot;That's the stuff!&quot; cried Tom. &quot;Now to get at the gold!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, get out the diving suits,&quot; added Mr. Damon. &quot;Bless
 my watch-charm, I think I'll chance it in one myself! Do you
 think the sharks are all gone, Captain Weston?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think so.&quot;</p>

<p>In a short time Tom, the captain, Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon
 were attired in the diving suits, Mr. Swift not caring to
 venture into such a great depth of water. Besides, it was
 necessary for at least one person to remain in the submarine
 to operate the diving chamber.</p>

<p>Walking slowly along the bottom of the sea the four gold-
 seekers approached the wreck. They looked on all sides for a
 sight of the sharks, but the monster fish seemed to have
 deserted that part of the ocean. Tom was the first to reach
 the now disrupted steamer. He found he could easily climb
 up, for boxes and barrels from the cargo holds were
 scattered all about by the explosion. Captain Weston soon
 joined the lad. The sailor motioned Tom to follow him, and
 being more familiar with ocean craft the captain was
 permitted to take the lead. He headed aft, seeking to locate
 the captain's cabin. Nor was he long in finding it. He
 motioned for the others to enter, that the combined
 illumination of the lamps in their helmets would make the
 place bright enough so a search could be made for the gold.
 Tom suddenly seized the arm of the captain, and pointed to
 one corner of the cabin. There stood a small safe, and at
 the sight of it Captain Weston moved toward it. The door was
 not locked, probably having been left open when the ship was
 deserted. Swinging it back the interior was revealed.</p>

<p>It was empty. There was no gold bullion in it.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the dejected air of Captain Weston.
 The others shared his feelings, but though they all felt
 like voicing their disappointment, not a word could be
 spoken. Mr. Sharp, by vigorous motions, indicated to his
 companions to seek further.</p>

<p>They did so, spending all the rest of the day in the
 wreck, save for a short interval for dinner. But no gold
 rewarded their search.</p>

<p>Tom, late that afternoon, wandered away from the others,
 and found himself in the captain's cabin again, with the
 empty safe showing dimly in the water that was all about.</p>

<p>&quot;Hang it all!&quot; thought the lad, &quot;we've had all our trouble
 for nothing! They must have taken the gold with them.&quot;</p>

<p>Idly he raised his steel bar, and struck it against the
 partition back of the safe. To his astonishment the
 partition seemed to fall inward, revealing a secret
 compartment. The lad leaned forward to bring the light for
 his helmet to play on the recess. He saw a number of boxes,
 piled one upon the other. He had accidentally touched a
 hidden spring and opened a secret receptacle. But what did
 it contain?</p>

<p>Tom reached in and tried to lift one of the boxes. He
 found it beyond his strength. Trembling from excitement, he
 went in search of the others. He found them delving in the
 after part of the wreck, but by motions our hero caused them
 to follow him. Captain Weston showed the excitement he felt
 as soon as he caught sight of the boxes. He and Mr. Sharp
 lifted one out, and placed it on the cabin floor. They pried
 off the top with their bars.</p>

<p>There, packed in layers, were small yellow bars; dull,
 gleaming, yellow bars! It needed but a glance to show that
 they were gold bullion. Tom had found the treasure. The lad
 tried to dance around there in the cabin of the wreck,
 nearly three miles below the surface of the ocean, but the
 pressure of water was too much for him. Their trip had been
 successful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CH25" id="CH25">Chapter Twenty-Five</a></h2>

<h3>Home With the Gold</h3>

<p>There was no time to be lost. They were in a treacherous
 part of the ocean, and strong currents might at any time
 further break up the wreck, so that they could not come at
 the gold. It was decided, by means of motions, to at once
 transfer the treasure to the submarine. As the boxes were
 too heavy to carry easily, especially as two men, who were
 required to lift one, could not walk together in the
 uncertain footing afforded by the wreck, another plan was
 adopted. The boxes were opened and the bars, a few at a
 time, were dropped on a firm, sandy place at the side of the
 wreck. Tom and Captain Weston did this work, while Mr. Sharp
 and Mr. Damon carried the bullion to the diving chamber of
 the Advance. They put the yellow bars inside, and when quite
 a number had been thus shifted, Mr. Swift, closing the
 chamber, pumped the water out and removed the gold. Then he
 opened the chamber to the divers again, and the process was
 repeated, until all the bullion had been secured.</p>

<p>
 Tom would have been glad to make a further examination of
 the wreck, for he thought he could get some of the rifles
 the ship carried, but Captain Weston signed to him not to
 attempt this.</p>

<p>The lad went to the pilot house, while his father and Mr.
 Sharp took their places in the engine-room. The gold had
 been safely stowed in Mr. Swift's cabin.</p>

<p>Tom took a last look at the wreck before he gave the
 starting signal. As he gazed at the bent and twisted mass of
 steel that had once been a great ship, he saw something
 long, black and shadowy moving around from the other side,
 coming across the bows.</p>

<p>&quot;There's another big shark,&quot; he observed to Captain
 Weston. &quot;They're coming back after us.&quot;</p>

<p>The captain did not speak. He was staring at the dark
 form. Suddenly, from what seemed the pointed nose of it,
 there gleamed a light, as from some great eye.</p>

<p>&quot;Look at that!&quot; cried Tom. &quot;That's no shark!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you want my opinion,&quot; remarked the sailor, &quot;I should
 say it was the other submarine--that of Berg and his
 friends--the Wonder. They've managed to fix up their craft
 and are after the gold.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But they're too late!&quot; cried Tom excitedly. &quot;Let's tell
 them so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; advised the captain. &quot;We don't want any trouble with
 them.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Swift came forward to see why his son had not given
 the signal to start. He was shown the other submarine, for
 now that the Wonder had turned on several searchlights,
 there was no doubt as to the identity of the craft.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's get away unobserved if we can,&quot; he suggested. &quot;We
 have had trouble enough.&quot;</p>

<p>It was easy to do this, as the Advance was hidden behind
 the wreck, and her lights were glowing but dimly. Then, too,
 those in the other submarine were so excited over the
 finding of what they supposed was the wreck containing the
 treasure, that they paid little attention to anything else.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder how they'll feel when they find the gold gone?&quot;
 asked Tom as he pulled the lever starting the pumps.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we may have a chance to learn, when we get back to
 civilization,&quot; remarked the captain.</p>

<p>The surface was soon reached, and then, under fair skies,
 and on a calm sea, the voyage home was begun. Part of the
 time the Advance sailed on the top, and part of the time
 submerged.</p>

<p>They met with but a single accident, and that was when the
 forward electrical plate broke. But with the aft one still
 in commission, and the auxiliary screws, they made good
 time. Just before reaching home they settled down to the
 bottom and donned the diving suits again, even Mr. Swift
 taking his turn. Mr. Damon caught some large lobsters, of
 which he was very fond, or, rather, to be more correct, the
 lobsters caught him. When he entered the diving chamber
 there were four fine ones clinging to different parts of his
 diving suit. Some of them were served for dinner.</p>

<p>The adventurers safely reached the New Jersey coast, and
 the submarine was docked. Mr. Swift at once communicated
 with the proper authorities concerning the recovery of the
 gold. He offered to divide with the actual owners, after he
 and his friends had been paid for their services, but as the
 revolutionary party to whom the bullion was intended had
 gone out of existence, there was no one to officially claim
 the treasure, so it all went to Tom and his friends, who
 made an equitable distribution of it. The young inventor did
 not forget to buy Mrs. Baggert a fine diamond ring, as he
 had promised.</p>

<p>As for Berg and his employers, they were, it was learned
 later, greatly chagrined at finding the wreck valueless.
 They tried to make trouble for Tom and his father, but were
 not successful.</p>

<p>A few days after arriving at the seacoast cottage, Tom,
 his father and Mr. Damon went to Shopton in the airship.
 Captain Weston, Garret Jackson and Mr Sharp remained behind
 in charge of the submarine. It was decided that the Swifts
 would keep the craft and not sell it to the Government, as
 Tom said they might want to go after more treasure some day.</p>

<p>&quot;I must first deposit this gold,&quot; said Mr. Swift as the
 airship landed in front of the shed at his home. &quot;It won't
 do to keep it in the house over night, even if the Happy
 Harry gang is in jail.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom helped him take it to the bank. As they were making
 perhaps the largest single deposit ever put in the
 institution, Ned Newton came out.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Tom,&quot; he cried to his chum, &quot;it seems that you are
 never going to stop doing things. You've conquered the air,
 the earth and the water.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What have you been doing while I've been under water,
 Ned?&quot; asked the young inventor.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, the same old thing. Running errands and doing all
 sorts of work in the bank.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom had a sudden idea. He whispered to his father and Mr.
 Swift nodded. A little later he was closeted with Mr.
 Prendergast, the bank president. It was not long before Ned
 and Tom were called in.</p>

<p>&quot;I have some good news for you, Ned,&quot; said Mr.
 Prendergast, while Tom smiled. &quot;Mr. Swift er--ahem--one of
 our largest depositors, has spoken to me about you, Ned. I
 find that you have been very faithful. You are hereby
 appointed assistant cashier, and of course you will get a
 much larger salary.&quot;</p>

<p>Ned could hardly believe it, but he knew then what Tom had
 whispered to Mr. Swift. The wishes of a depositor who brings
 much gold bullion to a bank can hardly be ignored.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on out and have some soda,&quot; invited Tom, and when
 Ned looked inquiringly at the president, the latter nodded
 an assent.</p>

<p>As the two lads were crossing the street to a drug store,
 something whizzed past them, nearly running them down.</p>

<p>&quot;What sort of an auto was that?&quot; cried Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;That? Oh, that was Andy Foger's new car,&quot; answered Ned.
 &quot;He's been breaking the speed laws every day lately, but no
 one seems to bother him. It's because his father is rich, I
 suppose. Andy says he has the fastest car ever built.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He has, eh?&quot; remarked Tom, while a curious look came into
 his eyes. &quot;Well, maybe I can build one that will beat his.&quot;</p>

<p>And whether the young inventor did or not you can learn by
 reading the fifth volume of this series, to be called &quot;Tom
 Swift and His Electric Runabout; Or, The Speediest Car on
 the Road.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Tom, I certainly appreciate what you did for me in
 getting me a better position,&quot; remarked Ned as they left the
 drug store. &quot;I was beginning to think I'd never get
 promoted. Say, have you anything to do this evening? If you
 haven't, I wish you'd come over to my house. I've got a lot
 of pictures I took while you were away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, but I can't,&quot; replied Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, are you going to build another airship or
submarine?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, but I'm going to see-- Oh, what do you want to know
 for, anyhow?&quot; demanded the young inventor with a blush.
 &quot;Can't a fellow go see a girl without being
cross-questioned?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, of course,&quot; replied Ned with a laugh. &quot;Give Miss
 Nestor my regards,&quot; and at this Tom blushed still more. But,
 as he said, that was his own affair.</p>

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TOM SWIFT AND HIS SUBMARINE BOAT ***

This file should be named 04tom10h.htm or 04tom10h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, 04tom11.txt
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 04tom10a.txt

This Etext was prepared for Project Gutenberg by Anthony Matonac.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE

receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it

such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.
